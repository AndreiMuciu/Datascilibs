Avaiga/taipy,3052352402,2610,[🐛 BUG] Text disappears in certain condition,"### 🔍 What went wrong?

It seems that having a multiline string with `""""""` and a line break before the text will make the text disappear.

### ✅ Expected Behavior

It should not disappear.

### 🔄 Steps to Reproduce

Run:
```python
import taipy.gui.builder as tgb
from taipy.gui import Gui

selected_tutorial = ""Test""

with tgb.Page() as page:
    tgb.text(
        """"""
Finding a rate: {selected_tutorial}"""""",
    )

Gui(page).run()

```

The page will show nothing.

The page

Avaiga/taipy,3050649437,2609,[✨ FEATURE] Improve table stylekit,"### 🔍 Feature Description

In the following image, the first row is selected and I'm hovering over the second row. The background color is (almost?) the same:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f04e3ad-ba05-41a6-ac97-2da1946f3aa7)

It would be good to be more visually obvious when a row is selected vs. hovered.

Example code:

```python
import taipy.gui.builder as tgb
from taipy import Gui

data = {""a"": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ""b"": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}

selected = [0]


def num_on_action(state, var_name, payload):
    index = payload.get(""index"")
    if index in state.selected:
        state.selected = list(set(state.selected) - {index})
    else:
        state.selected = state.selected + [index]


with tgb.Page() as page:
    tgb.toggle(theme=True)

    tgb.table(""{data}"", selected=""{selected}"", on_action=num_on_action)

    tgb.table(""{data}"", selected=""{selected}"", on_action=num_on_action, class_name=""rows-similar rows-bordered"")


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    gui = Gui(page=page)
    gui.run(run_browser=False, use_reloader=True)
```

Play around with:
1. Changing the theme
2. Selected different rows
3. Hovering over different rows

I quickly get very confused with the colors. It's much better on the table with ""rows-similar"" though.

### 💡 Proposed Solution

Overhaul the stylekit for taipy tables. Consider interaction with:
1. Theme
2. ""rows-similar"" stylekit class
3. ""selected"" rows (Mui-selected)
4. Hovering on selected/unselected rows

Consider adding:
1. Different background color for table header row
