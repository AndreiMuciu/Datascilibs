apache/airflow,3057036851,50491,BranchingOperator fails when using custom backend xcom deserialization with NoCredentialsError,"### Apache Airflow version

2.10.5

### If ""Other Airflow 2 version"" selected, which one?

_No response_

### What happened?

I'm encountering an issue when deserializing XComs using a custom XCom backend that loads data from S3 using `S3Hook(aws_conn_id='aws')`. `aws` is the connection Id defined with the aws credentials. The same code is working for Airflow 2.10.4 but not anymore from 2.10.5 and further. 

Despite having a valid AWS connection configured in Airflow (visible and **working well** in **ALL** other parts of the DAG), I get the following error during deserialization steps:

```botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials```` 

With the function:

```
hook = S3Hook(aws_conn_id='aws')
head_object = hook.head_object(key=key, bucket_name='bucket')
```

This error is not visible in the Airflow UI but I found it in the scheduler container's logs. The branching task is set as success but the following branched task is queued 'forever'. I assume this error is coming from the following task which is pulling a xcom. 

After switching to manual session initialization using `boto3.Session(...)`, I still have the same error... BUT it is working and I am settings the aws credentials directly inside the code, without trying to get the `aws` Connection Id. This is telling me that in the specific case of BranchingOperator, something is happening and the follwing task' context doesn't have the connection Id anymore. 







### What you think should happen instead?

The 'aws' connection is not resolved correctly anymore by the scheduler, even though it is defined in Airflow. The context might have changed?

### How to reproduce

```
class CustomXComBackendPandas(BaseXCom):
    XCOM_PREFIX = ""xcom_s3://""
    S3_PATH_PREFIX = ""tmp""
    _BUCKET_NAME = """"
    DATAFRAME_EXTENSION = "".parquet""

@staticmethod
    def deserialize_value(result: BaseXCom) -> Any:
            hook = S3Hook(aws_conn_id='aws')
            head_object = hook.head_object(key='key', bucket_name='bucket')

```

cc @eladkal 

## Why

- prevents infinite polling when monitored failure
- correctly propagates failure status back to calling workflow

## How

- fix `WorkflowTrigger` to continue checking allowed_states when no failed states are found
- update `ExternalTaskSensor.execute_complete` to properly handle ""failed"" status
- add tests to verify behaviors

apache/airflow,3056267650,50481,sla miss alert duplicated,"### Apache Airflow version

Other Airflow 2 version (please specify below)

### If ""Other Airflow 2 version"" selected, which one?

2.5.3

### What happened?

A certain task ran and exceeded the set SLA miss timeout period, then triggered an SLA miss event. The pre-written SLA miss callback function was called, and alarm messages were sent to the DingTalk group.
Now there are some tasks that trigger SLA miss multiple times. The corresponding callback functions are called, and alarm messages are sent to DingTalk multiple times as well. The alarm contents are exactly the same. I don't know how to handle this.

### What you think should happen instead?

The callback function for the SLA miss of the task is only invoked once and only one alarm message is sent.

### How to reproduce

It occurs occasionally at present and we still don't know how to reproduce it.

**The document includes step-by-step instructions to help users with Apple Silicon install Apache Airflow**

- The added instructions explain how Mac users with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) should use `pyenv` to install Python and should not employ system/Homebrew Python versions which get labeled `--externally-managed`.

- Such setup methods help prevent dependency problems that appear during Apache Airflow installation on macOS devices.

**Notes**:
I am a new contributor to the project and wrote this version by hand according to my previous setup experience and prior discussion feedback. I need confirmation about modifying the text if so desired. Thanks!

Thank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes
are covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes
remember to adjust the documentation.

Feel free to ping committers for the review!

In case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:

closes: #ISSUE
related: #ISSUE

closes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/50475

We can now classify commits in providers wave to be ""v"" (min airflow version bump).

For such cases, the changelog should be robust enough to help with that.

I am adding a new feature that helps with this classification. If there's a `v` classified, we passdown a flag that will update the changelog for us.

I am not updating any global jinja context, just keeping it local to changelog generation: `_generate_new_changelog`

apache/airflow,3055232782,50470,Change CohereHook.get_conn type from property to method in the next major apache-airflow-providers-cohere,"Hi all,

I want to raise this PR to resolve the issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/38350
Closes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/38350
The main changes include
* Refactor the `@cached_property` decorated `get_conn(self)` to a regular method.
* Add a private attribute `self._client` to store the client instance. If the attribute is already initialized to a client instance, this instance will be reused.
* The other methods that reference the `get_conn` attribute are also refactored to use `get_conn()` method.

All the test cases related to the Cohere providers are checked and updated correspondingly. Unit tests are run successfully.

Thank you for your time to review in advance, and I would appreciate any feedback, and let me know if there is any potential change needed for the PR.

apache/airflow,3055159076,50466,[v2-11-test] Install sphinx-airflow-theme package from GitHub release…,"… not `pypi` (#50459)

We do not need to publish sphinx-airflow-theme in PyPI - we can simply install the package directly from the wheel file published during `main` build of the `airflow-site` - this way we will always use the latest ""main"" version of the theme and we have no need to publish such newer versions of packages to PyPI.

This means that any committer can modify site theme and build it in sites and after merging to main, the theme will be used automatically from there.
(cherry picked from commit eb194c9e5568bc1c42dfd122ccb9984858ea5333)

## Related Issue

- #49334
cc: @eladkal

## Why 

`get_pandas_df` deprecated in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48875, which would be replaced by `get_df`. Thus, we need to migrate them in providers.

## How

After investigation, I found that `ElasticsearchSQLHook` has its own `ElasticsearchSQLCursor` which is not compatable with polars cursor execution since there is a abstraction for cursor execution when calling `polars.read_database`.  

reference: [polars.read_database](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/blob/5c114f0f32a62bf796629e4ccf01b93146ae22c4/py-polars/polars/io/database/functions.py#L247-L256) and the abstraction called _executor [_executor](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/blob/main/py-polars/polars/io/database/_executor.py)

Also there is nothing about the integration info on [polars IO document](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/io/) and [Elasticsearch document](https://search.elastic.co/?q=polars) thus I thought it would be better to raise `NotImplementedError` for it like we did in #50017.

Minor change: migrate to `common-sql` 1.27.0 to have better `get_df` type def

apache/airflow,3054546927,50446,Preserve all context keys during serialization,"When instantiating a PythonVirtualenvOperator, part of the context is propagated based on the requirements constructor parameter. The current logic implementation prevents 'pendulum' or 'apache-airflow' keys to be added to the Airflow context as soon as a version specifier is used.

For instance this requirement list will have the expected behavior:
```python
        op = PythonVirtualenvOperator(

Whereas this one will cause the `pendulum` objects to be stripped out of the context:

        op = PythonVirtualenvOperator(
            task_id=""task"",
            python_callable=func,

## Related Issue

#50396

## Why

We need bulk endpoint to support mulit-selection in ui thus this PR focus on implementation of TI bulk actions api

## How

- implement it based on connection, pool and variable bulk endpoint
- override the `BulkService` to pass `dag_id` and `dag_run_id`

Not sure if we should let users create TI by themselves thus I didn't implement it now. If needed, I could add it.

apache/airflow,3054395435,50441,Impove dynamic DAG generation docs,"### Description

The main purpose of this MR is to enhance documentation by describing a way for `Abstraction of DAG objects generation` following the discussion from [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/50020). I strongly believe this part is essential in docs because it shows an easy way for creating an abstraction for DAG templates and reusing it both in single DAG generation and in dynamic way.

Currently back-references are only run for the current (released) version of the provider/airflow - as a workflow in `apache-airflow` repo - but they should be run in the `airflow-sites-archive` as part of `sync to S3`  because there, all the back-references should be applied to older versions as well.

apache/airflow,3054006596,50433,"add a ""warning"" status for tasks","### Description

As we can see here https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.9/concepts.html#id4
The lifecycle of a task is pretty clear, and this lifecycle seems clearly related to the way airflow internally handles the tasks. I propose to have a new status along with Success, failed, shutdown.

This status would be ""Warning"" or ""Success with Warnings"" and will act as a success, allowing dependent tasks to run.

### Use case/motivation

In complex ETL pipelines, especially where scrapping is included, you might have a scrapping task at the beginning of the chain that, if failed will prevent all subsequent tasks to run.

You might want to write a really nice scrapper DAG that is smart and detects that there are some issues whit the data scrapped, but that it is ok in some way, or at least is not ""THAT"" problematic that it requires a failed state and block all other tasks.
In such case, you only have two option: Success or failure. It means that is your task is smart enough to detect that that data scrapped is good enough, but there are problems that should be taken care off, the only option currently is to implement a home made ""visualization/notification"" system, like sending an email to the inbox so that the person in charge can have a look. Otherwise, it's just binary: ok/nok

It would be wonderful to have a way to set the DAG to this new status so that it can clearly be reflected into the dashboard.
I understand that currently the statuses reflect the way the tasks are handled by airflow and is completely agnostic of what is done inside the task. but in some way, the failed status is already aware that something went wrong into the task.

It would be even better if the task could automatically put itself in status warning when it detects the use of logger.info() or logger.error()

This MR adds the `webserver_config.py` file to the api server, similar to how it was included to the webserver in version <3. I've had to add the `webserver_config.py` file when configuring OAuth in my local setup, where it worked as expected.

Open question: In version <3, the `webserver_config.py` was mounted into all deployments (as well as the pod template for the KubernetesOperator) if defined. I didn't add it as I don't think it should be necessary, but please let me know if it has to be added

apache/airflow,3053955035,50431,"Work out better strategy for ""stable""","### Body

For now ""stable"" is a copy of latest version of the provider / airflow docs. It used to be a symbolic link. I think currently we had at least a few cases where stable was a bit different than the released version and it cause some problems (like snowflake drop-down problem). We should think if there is a good way to keep stable and ""latest"" version the same - maybe we can implement some redirection rules ?

## Why

PoolSummary Bar and Health Badges have a 2px misalignment issue caused by the inner height style of the `Link` component, which makes whole component a little bit higher.

This issue is really really nit but the summary bar is crafted by me so it's really hard to ignore this when every time I open Airflow dashboard.

## How

- fix by the link height right equals to the title
- remove unused style of the link of pool summary link

before

apache/airflow,3053944146,50429,Fix parallelism settings in s3/gh syncing,"### Body

Hey @gopidesupavan  - I think we can remove all the parallel stuff from s3/gh syncing. From what I understand `aws s3 cp` and `aws s3 sync` already support parallel uploads and downloads and we can even control the parallelism there - so I think we can significantly simplify our syncing code - by not spawning multiple processes in pools. I think what we have now even causes some contentions and occasional errors when we run the cli commands in parallel - see https://github.com/apache/airflow-site-archive/actions/runs/14936817797/job/41966102337#step:11:402 and https://github.com/apache/airflow-site-archive/actions/runs/14936549582/job/41965209960 for example.

WDYT? 

Also it woudl be nice to enable progress - I think both `cp` and `sync` can show progress while doing stuff.

With ASF  + Cloudfront for our S3 buckets now, cache invalidation becomes an issue.

_No response_

### What happened?

MetastoreBackend, get_connection, get_variable - maybe return RuntimeError, but obj get.

### What you think should happen instead?

Use MetastoreBackend just select sql, get obj. But use provide_session maybe return Error msg = UNEXPECTED COMMIT - THIS WILL BREAK HA LOCKS!
Should I give the error a more specific name and skip it in certain places?

apache/airflow,3053488544,50420,Support running `airflow dags test` from local files,"Currently, we can't run `airflow dags test` in isolation with a local dag file. We need to first run `airflow dags reserialize`, so DAGs are parsed and stored in DB, because the `airflow dags test` currently loads it from DB.

The change in this PR/commit allows testing DAGs from different sources:
- Using bundle configuration (`--bundle-name`)
- Using direct file path (`--dagfile-path`/`-f`)
- Using default behavior (from DB)

This speeds up the process too since we don't have to load the entire DagBag to run a single file.

apache/airflow,3053404056,50419,Fix bug with in-process request handling for `dag.test`,"Fixes a subtle bug where `SUPERVISOR_COMMS` was incorrectly set during supervisor-side request handling in `InProcessSupervisorComms.send_request()` -- reported in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/50300#issuecomment-2867610759 (Based on debugging a failure in the `example_athena` system test under `dag.test()`). It also now prevents regressions for other DAGs/tasks that rely on connection or variable fetches inside Task SDK runtime

### Problem
When calling the supervisor’s `_handle_request()` (e.g. in response to a connection or variable fetch), some internal logic (like `Variable.get()` or `Connection.get_connection_from_secrets()`) would incorrectly detect that it was running in a Task SDK execution context — because `SUPERVISOR_COMMS` was still set.

This led to recursive calls into the SDK flow (e.g., calling `SUPERVISOR_COMMS.lock`) **while already holding the lock**, resulting in `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lock'` or deadlocks.

This caused bug when using `dag.test()` in system tests that specifically rely on connections or variables:
- Tasks attempting to fetch a connection during execution caused the supervisor to recurse into its own comms path
- This led to incorrect error handling (`500 Internal Server Error`) and test failures

### Fix
- The fix ensures `SUPERVISOR_COMMS` is temporarily unset while handling the request.
- This prevents Task SDK context detection logic from activating during supervisor API handling.
- The `set_supervisor_comms(None)` context manager is now explicitly used within `send_request()` to guard the call to `_handle_request()`.

### Why this matters
This fixes real bugs encountered when using `dag.test()` in system tests that rely on connections or variables:
- Tasks attempting to fetch a connection during execution caused the supervisor to recurse into its own comms path
- This led to incorrect error handling (`500 Internal Server Error`) and test failures

### To Reproduce

Use following dag on main:
```py
from airflow.sdk import Variable, dag, task

@dag
def xample_simplest_dag():
    @task
    def my_task():
        print(""hellooo"")
        import os
        # os.environ[""AIRFLOW_VAR_MY_VARIABLE""] = ""my_value""
        assert Variable.get(""my_variable"") == ""my_value""

    my_task()


d = xample_simplest_dag()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    d.test(use_executor=False)
```

and run:

```
python /files/dags/example_simplest_dag.py
```

Which will cause:

```
...

Task instance is in running state
 Previous state of the Task instance: TaskInstanceState.QUEUED
Current task name:my_task
Dag name:xample_simplest_dag
hellooo

### Add `gitConfig` Option to Airflow Helm Chart for Custom Git Configuration

This pull request introduces the following changes:

1. **`gitConfig` Parameter**:
   - Added a new parameter, `gitConfig`, to the Apache Airflow Helm chart. This allows users to specify custom Git configuration settings for the `git-sync` sidecar container, offering more flexibility in managing Git behavior during DAG synchronization.

2. **Airflow API Server Update**:
   - Updated the `NOTES.txt` to reflect the usage of `.apiServer` instead of `.web` for Airflow v3 deployments, aligning with the updated configuration style for Airflow v3 and improving compatibility with newer versions of the platform.

#### 🔧 Changes Introduced

- **New Configuration Field**:
  - `dags.gitSync.gitConfig`: Accepts a list of Git configuration entries, enabling users to set custom Git configurations such as user identity, credential helpers, and other Git settings.

- **Airflow Web to API Server Update**:
  - Modified `NOTES.txt` to replace `.web` with `.apiServer`, which is the correct configuration for Airflow v3, ensuring the Helm chart is aligned with the latest Airflow version.

This addition aligns with the existing `git-sync` capabilities and allows for more tailored Git interactions within Airflow deployments.

#### 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Verified that custom Git configurations specified via `gitConfig` are correctly applied within the `git-sync` container.
- Ensured that the addition of `gitConfig` does not interfere with existing `git-sync` functionality or other Helm chart configurations.
- Confirmed that the `.apiServer` setting is correctly used in Airflow v3 and does not affect backward compatibility with Airflow v2.

#### 📚 Documentation

- Updated the Helm chart documentation to include the new `gitConfig` parameter, with examples demonstrating its usage.
- Adjusted `NOTES.txt` to reflect the `.apiServer` setting for Airflow v3 deployments, ensuring correct configuration for Airflow v3 clusters.

#### 🔄 Backward Compatibility

This change is backward compatible. If `gitConfig` is not specified, the `git-sync` container will operate with its default Git configuration.
- The change from `.web` to `.apiServer` in `notes.txt` is only relevant for Airflow v3 deployments and does not affect Airflow v2.

#### 📌 Related Issues

This enhancement addresses the need for more customizable Git configurations within the Airflow Helm chart's `git-sync` setup so it is possible to use all git providers, including Azure DevOps Repos.

---

By introducing the `gitConfig` parameter, this update provides users with enhanced control over Git behavior in their Airflow deployments, facilitating more complex and customized workflows.

## Related Issue

#49741

## Why 

Following PR for #50309, this PR focus on implementing cross dag run task group detail page

## How

- implement for cross dag run
- add group breadcrumb

## Note
Task group can't be fetch by getTask and thus I use the grid endpoint to get  task group in `Task` component following Brent's suggestion in #49741. Not really sure what info should be display on the group task header, thus please let me know if the header need any change. Thanks!

<h3>Owner Stack</h3>
<p>An Owner Stack is a string representing the components that are directly responsible for rendering a particular component. You can log Owner Stacks when debugging or use Owner Stacks to enhance error overlays or other development tools. Owner Stacks are only available in development builds. Component Stacks in production are unchanged.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Owner Stack is a development-only stack trace that helps identify which components are responsible for rendering a particular component. An Owner Stack is distinct from a Component Stacks, which shows the hierarchy of components leading to an error.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://react.dev/reference/react/captureOwnerStack"">captureOwnerStack API</a> is only available in development mode and returns a Owner Stack, if available.

apache/airflow,3052433593,50400,Enhance Helm Chart to Support Git Authentication via Kubernetes Secrets + Update for airflow v3 to get api server instead of web server,"### Add `gitConfig` Option to Airflow Helm Chart for Custom Git Configuration

This pull request introduces the following changes:

1. **`gitConfig` Parameter**:
   - Added a new parameter, `gitConfig`, to the Apache Airflow Helm chart. This allows users to specify custom Git configuration settings for the `git-sync` sidecar container, offering more flexibility in managing Git behavior during DAG synchronization.

2. **Airflow API Server Update**:
   - Updated the `NOTES.txt` to reflect the usage of `.apiServer` instead of `.web` for Airflow v3 deployments, aligning with the updated configuration style for Airflow v3 and improving compatibility with newer versions of the platform.

#### 🔧 Changes Introduced

- **New Configuration Field**:
  - `dags.gitSync.gitConfig`: Accepts a list of Git configuration entries, enabling users to set custom Git configurations such as user identity, credential helpers, and other Git settings.

- **Airflow Web to API Server Update**:
  - Modified `NOTES.txt` to replace `.web` with `.apiServer`, which is the correct configuration for Airflow v3, ensuring the Helm chart is aligned with the latest Airflow version.

This addition aligns with the existing `git-sync` capabilities and allows for more tailored Git interactions within Airflow deployments. This also enables git-sync to be used with Azure DevOps repos since that one needs hardcoded organization name on the URL to work, and it conflicts when you pass the credentials username and password saying the username is already coded in the URL.

To use Azure DevOps as a source now simply pass the organization as username and PAT as password, and remove the organization from the URL, then add to your dags.gitsync:
dags:
  gitSync:
    credentialsSecret: airflow-git-creds
    gitConfig:
      - name: credential.useHttpPath
        value: ""true""

#### 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Verified that custom Git configurations specified via `gitConfig` are correctly applied within the `git-sync` container.
- Ensured that the addition of `gitConfig` does not interfere with existing `git-sync` functionality or other Helm chart configurations.
- Confirmed that the `.apiServer` setting is correctly used in Airflow v3 and does not affect backward compatibility with Airflow v2.

#### 📚 Documentation

- Updated the Helm chart documentation to include the new `gitConfig` parameter, with examples demonstrating its usage.
- Adjusted `NOTES.txt` to reflect the `.apiServer` setting for Airflow v3 deployments, ensuring correct configuration for Airflow v3 clusters.

#### 🔄 Backward Compatibility

This change is backward compatible. If `gitConfig` is not specified, the `git-sync` container will operate with its default Git configuration.
- The change from `.web` to `.apiServer` in `notes.txt` is only relevant for Airflow v3 deployments and does not affect Airflow v2.

#### 📌 Related Issues

This enhancement addresses the need for more customizable Git configurations within the Airflow Helm chart's `git-sync` setup so it is possible to use all git providers, including Azure DevOps Repos.

---

By introducing the `gitConfig` parameter, this update provides users with enhanced control over Git behavior in their Airflow deployments, facilitating more complex and customized workflows.

Using json when casting collections to string in OL can be helpful for consumers, especially for things like DAG tags that are now casted with `str()` which can sometimes be hard to reverse. This is still compliant with the spec, we keep it as string, only changing the quotes for consistent ones really.

For Snowflake and DBT, we are emitting OL events with OL client. I think we should do it with adapter instead, that has some additional logic around `client.emit` method - metrics, logging the exception and redacting the event.

This PR adds OpenLineage support for `DatabricksSqlHook` and therefore `DatabricksSqlOperator`. It also introduces caching the hook on the operator level and gathering Databricks query_ids in the Hook when executing queries.

The OpenLineage logic implemented in `DatabricksSqlHook` is very similar to all other database Hooks already supported, and implementing a common interface from `DbApiHook`:

- Snowflake implementation [url](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/snowflake/src/airflow/providers/snowflake/hooks/snowflake.py#L562). 
- Redshift implementation [url](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/amazon/src/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/redshift_sql.py#L205).
- All supported hooks [url](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html#sqlexecutequeryoperator)

This PR also implements a very similar logic as in [Snowflake provider](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/snowflake/src/airflow/providers/snowflake/utils/openlineage.py) on how to deal with multiple query_ids - we are sending pair of OpenLineage events for each query run, if there are more than one per operator run.

I've also updated the OpenLineage documentation to make it clear for the users how the support works for operators that inherit from SqlExecuteQueryOperator.

apache/airflow,3051746739,50389,default_args causes .partial() to fail with TypeError during dynamic task mapping,"### Apache Airflow version

3.0.0

### If ""Other Airflow 2 version"" selected, which one?

_No response_

### What happened?

In Airflow 3, using `default_args` that include keys not accepted by a particular operator now causes `.partial()` to raise a TypeError during dynamic task mapping (expand() or expand_kwargs()).

This strict argument validation did not exist in Airflow 2.x, where it was common and valid to use shared default_args (e.g., poke_interval, email, etc.) across multiple operators, even if some operators ignored keys they didn’t use. The change in Airflow 3 breaks this pattern, and results in DAGs failing to parse.

For example, a DAG that uses a sensor (which accepts poke_interval) and a BashOperator (which does not), and shares the same default_args, will now fail when .partial() is used with BashOperator.

### What you think should happen instead?

Airflow should ignore irrelevant default_args keys during .partial() resolution — just as it does during regular operator instantiation — or provide a clear mechanism for filtering them automatically.

At a minimum, if strict validation is the intended design going forward, this should be:

- Documented as a breaking change in Airflow 3,
- and ideally offer a pattern for DAG authors to safely reuse default_args with mixed operator types and dynamic task mapping.

### How to reproduce

Here’s a minimal DAG that fails in Airflow 3:

```
from airflow.sdk import DAG, task
from airflow.providers.standard.operators.bash import BashOperator

default_args = {
    'start_date': None,
    'poke_interval': 300,  # Valid for sensors, invalid for BashOperator
}

with DAG(
    dag_id='dynamic_task_mapping_default_args_bug',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    @task
    def get_commands():
        return [{""bash_command"": ""echo hello""}]

    BashOperator.partial(
        task_id=""run_bash""
    ).expand_kwargs(get_commands())
```

The DAG fails to parse with the following error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/opt/airflow/task-sdk/src/airflow/sdk/definitions/mappedoperator.py"", line 171, in __attrs_post_init__
    validate_mapping_kwargs(self.operator_class, ""partial"", self.kwargs)
  File ""/opt/airflow/task-sdk/src/airflow/sdk/definitions/mappedoperator.py"", line 118, in validate_mapping_kwargs
    raise TypeError(f""{op.__name__}.{func}() got {error}"")
TypeError: BashOperator.partial() got an unexpected keyword argument 'poke_interval'
```

Other Docker-based deployment

### Deployment details

N/A

### Anything else?

- This issue affects all operators that don’t support a subset of keys in default_args when used with .partial() and dynamic task mapping.

- It breaks backward compatibility with many Airflow 2.x DAGs that used shared default_args.
