dagster-io/dagster,3053940513,29912,[dg] Refactor shims so operate on the RequestObject instead of splitting it apart,"## Summary & Motivation

`ShimScaffolder` had a bit of an odd inheritance structure. This new structure is more straightforward and makes it easier to overload and test

```python
class ShimScaffolder(Scaffolder[TModel]):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_text(self, request: ScaffoldRequest[TModel]) -> str: ...

    def scaffold(self, request: ScaffoldRequest[TModel]) -> None:
        if request.target_path.suffix != "".py"":
            raise ValueError(""Invalid target path suffix. Expected a path ending in `.py`."")
        # temporary hack as currently all scaffold requests target directories
        # that are auto-created
        request.target_path.rmdir()
        request.target_path.write_text(self.get_text(request))
```
