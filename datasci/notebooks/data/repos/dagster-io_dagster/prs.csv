First large dagster rearchitecture  …
1) Introduce the notion of Source definitions in addition to inputs.
A SourceDefinition represents a method of instantiating an input
into a transform that is not just flowing it from an upstream
dependency e.g. loading a file or just laoding a bag of key-value pairs

2) Introduce the notion of materializations. These are the mirror
images of sources, but for the output. A given output definition knows
zero or more ways to materialize itself.

materializations of pipelines.",schrockn,28738937,closed,False,2018-06-01T22:34:57+00:00,2018-06-07T18:08:41+00:00,2018-06-01T22:35:07+00:00,2018-06-01T22:35:07+00:00,bb72575127778bbec8506c0289ef704cb365c6d8,unknown,2057,1006,38,2,0,0,,,

dagster-io/dagster,206416615,70,Initial commit of the user-facing Dagster type system,"This PR adds a user-facing type system to dagster. Instead of
""typing"" solids by adding typechecks to input and output callback, one
can instead specify a type. This type itself knows how to do a
typecheck.

InputDefinition and OutputDefinitions now accept an optional type
argument (it defaults to the new Any type). This type
knows how to check to see if the runtime python type is compatible. It
also provides ""default"" sources and materializations.

Future enhancements could include a set of expectations along with
python type checks as well. This way expectations and the type system
would be unified.

There's a fair bit of noise in this PR at I used the addition
of the type system as an opportunity to clean up a bunch of stuff
to demonstrate value. The ""pandas kernel"" is much more simple, as
an example.",schrockn,28738937,closed,False,2018-08-06T14:27:22+00:00,2018-08-16T04:00:53+00:00,2018-08-06T16:44:36+00:00,2018-08-06T16:44:36+00:00,4fcbc5dd16083ba0350703dec93a53f7ce363255,unknown,544,547,34,1,0,0,freiksenet,,

dagster-io/dagster,208684418,77,Execution Rewrite: The Compute Node,"This is a substantial rewrite of the execution pipeline and will
open up a whole new range of explorations and more.

The core architectural change here is that there is an entire
new system of representation for the *execution* graph of computations
(compute nodes) rather than just the PipelineDefintion.

The compute node graph is constructed from the PipelineDefinition
and input config. A number of things happen during this construction:

1. All sources, materializations, expectations, and transforms are
modelled within the same abstraction: the compute node. All argument
checking and validiations are done during compute node graph
construction time, before any execution proceeds. This is similar to
validation as a separate step in the graphql universe.

2. Compute nodes can have multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and a
configuration dictionary (arg dict). This allows for maximum flexibility
and for it to be generic enough to handled the different concepts listed
in bullet 1. For example a source is just a compute node with *no*
inputs, a single output, and an arg dict. A materialization is a compute
node with an input (coming from the output of of a transform), no
outputs, and an arg dict. A transform can have multiple inputs and
(now) multiple outputs, but it current doesn't support an arbitrary arg
dict. Expectations are also a compute node.

3. This will allow for dynamically configured dependencies as opposed
to the more static construction. We are already using the dynamic
compute node graph to change based on policy. If, for example, you
do turn off expectations those compute nodes are never even
constructed. If they are they dynamically placed before the appopriate
input or after the appropriate output and set up to execute in parallel.

4. Sources and materializationsn as separate concepts are going to
largely dissappears. I am still toying with how to expose them to the
higher level config and pipeline definition API, but if they exist they
will be largely symbolic.

5. More sophisticated expectations execution will happen via this
mechanism. For example I fully anticipate that expectation compute nodes
will have two outputs, one for the value being tested and passed
through, but the other for the expectation result. This will allow the
framework (or the user in some capacity) to add compute nodes that act
on the expectation.

6. Composability: This is also an interesting angle for putting
composability into this execution engine. It should be totally possible
to build ""composite"" compute nodes that consist of a DAG of compute
nodes. When taken as a whole they will have a set of inputs, a set of
outputs, and a set of configuration.

7. Visualizations and debugging: This will be a powerful tool of
visualization and debugging. One will be able to set config, apply it to
a pipeline, and previz *exactly* what is going to execute in a very
granular way. Execution should be able to be reported through this
mechanism as well.

Next up I'm going to leverage this architectural change to change the
dependency API for pipeline definitions.",schrockn,28738937,closed,False,2018-08-15T21:18:11+00:00,2018-08-17T20:40:44+00:00,2018-08-17T20:40:39+00:00,2018-08-17T20:40:39+00:00,d19411e95d7e7bf93c73f8307e0dbe3de20761e0,dirty,1630,1428,25,1,0,0,,,

Instead of specifying every pipeline in a project individually in a yaml
file, we now just have a single repository.

The repository object creates pipelines on demand (so that they can be
loaded by name without loading all the pipelines).

Repositories *also* have the concept of library solids (which can be
thought of higher order solids) which are ways to create solids in a
config-driven way. Authors will be able to design library solids that
are resuable. This will enable a layer of solid creation via config, and

dagster-io/dagster,212620553,136,"Move from ""Argument Dictionary"" to proper composited type system","I decided that this move should be made before 0.2.0. This is, IMO, a
much more sound system of managing config.

Instead of having ""argument dictionaries"" everywhere, configs take a top
level type to describe themselves. I've implemented one composite type,
the accepts a set of Fields and then produced a python dict for
implementors to process at runtime.

This system has a number of advantages:

1) Configs can be arbitrarily nested and grouped together. This already
would have been immediately useful.

2) We can move to strongly-typed APIs for configs. Instead of vending a
dict, vend a namedtuple, for example.

3) Even further that 2) this is a step towards a formalized ""resource""
pattern for configs.  Instead of the type producing a dumb struct, you
could imagine the config producing a richer ""resource"" object that
manages connections or so forth. Or alternatively a system stacked on
top of this one that does that (and requires configs of a certain type).

4) This sets up the ability to support single value config quite easily.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it is possible now if we allow
it.

One clear deficiency is a regression of error messaging. However, we
weren't testing error messages properly the entire time!

dagster-io/dagster,214543454,170,Initial styling pass,"Hey folks! This PR styles the dagit interface a bit. I broke things out into small commits so you can read through the changes individually. Hopefully this is a good start and we can talk through more changes from here—we discussed a couple of these earlier (adding the Dagster logo, etc.), but I had a couple other goals in mind as well:

- Clean up the header sizes so they roughly follow information hierarchy.  (Solid name is too small?)
- Prevent long / autogenerated descriptions from blowing things up and making it difficult to see the forest through the trees. (Made them collapsible)
- Reduce the number of things that have borders and add more emphasis to types (because they're a big part of why this is so cool.)
- Replace nested section cards + solid cards with section headings + solid cards

Future:
- I think the ""inputs"", ""outputs"" and ""config"" blocks should share a visual language of some sort between the HTML and DAG. (For example we could use a green stripe to mark inputs in the DAG, and also in the solids ""reference"" section.)
- I'm a big fan of reflowing the DAG vertically and laying out the solid ""cards"" to the right hand side ala Python Notebooks, essentially combining the pipeline flow information with the solid information rather than having a bit of solid info in graph form and a bit in ""reference"" from. It's unclear what we'd do with pipelines that have ""wide"" / highly concurrent DAGs, though. We'll need a solution that allows the DAG to ""wrap"" or ""stack"" items a bit (maybe like spring-loaded items in the macOS dock.)

Sidenote:
- I'm not sure what to do about Solids that have very complex input / output types. It was a mess, and right justifying made it a worse mess. Maybe many of these are just easy to read because the types have been left as `any`... If the average case is more like this (screenshot), it might make sense to represent the inputs / outputs in table form:
