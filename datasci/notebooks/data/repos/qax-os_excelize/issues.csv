DefinedNames SheetNames are not escaped correctly, if a sheet gets renamed

## Description

Renaming a sheet might cause Microsoft Excel to show a warning that the file contains broken links. This happens if the sheet name contains whitespaces for example and definedNames referencing this sheet. This is also the reason why some sheet names are escaped and others not. This PR checks via regex for non word characters and escapes sheet names in definedNames if required. The current implementation only preserves already present escaping, even if it is not required anymore.
Currently ""Sheet 2!$A$1:$A$2""
Required ""'Sheet 2'!$A$1:$A$2""
