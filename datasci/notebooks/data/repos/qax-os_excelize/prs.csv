Hi,
I had some performance problems on the XLSX file I was trying to generate. I analysed the time spent in various places and found out that most of the time was spent in SetCellStyle, and that the slowness was caused by checkCellInArea.

I rewrote checkCellInArea. Among the changes:
- avoid all the conversions of cell/row/col that were not needed
- replace the part responsible for extracting the cell's col/row (e.g. ""BC42"" -> col ""BC"" and row ""42"") by not using strings.Map and stopping as soon as a digit is found

qax-os/excelize,241033175,319,#195: proposed resolution to the issue,"# PR Details

This PR fix the issue #195.

## Description

It checks if there's N (defined by the user) empty lines in sequence in the sheet, and if so, it stops the GetRows function. I also had a more than 1 million empty lines sheet.

## How Has This Been Tested

It was created a unit test that covers all code created. The overall coverage of the project still roughly the same, and it's all passing.

It was also made many api tests in an in house project, with different files. A simple file created by hand with few rows, and with a large file (~40k rows) from a real client.

Tests refactored.
All custom check replaced  with `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`.
Temporary maped dependency to `github.com/stretchr/testify@master` as of error fixed.

## Description

This commit is not ideal but necessary (IMHO)

## Related Issue

https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize/issues/322

## Motivation and Context

Primary motivation: Avoid statefull tests with not ignorable git file tree changes.
Multiple tests reads and overwrites single file for own needs.
Multiple tests reads and overwrites file `Book1.xlsx` under version control.

Secondary motivation: Minimal tests logic aligment, separate error expectation
and not error expectation tests. Introduce sub-test over test data sets and so far.

## How Has This Been Tested

Simple run `go test ./...` and checks `git status`

Do not create a blank fill if no fill is specified in the style format

## Description

setFills returns nil if type is not gradient or pattern.  NewStyle checks for nil and only adds fill / sets fillID if not nil.

## Related Issue

https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize/issues/331

## Motivation and Context

Setting a cell style on a cell that is part of a table overrides the table fill format regardless if there is a fill specified in the style format or not.  This only sets a fill on the style if provided a fill format in the call to NewStyle.

## How Has This Been Tested

Unit test added to styles_test.go for both a fill specified and fill not specified.

New feature: File.DuplicateRowTo() duplicate row to specified row position

## Description

DuplicateRowTo() is similar to DuplicateRow() but copies specified row not just after specified source row
but to any other specified position below or above source row.

Also I made minor modifications of tests: using filepath.Join() instead of direct unix-way paths strings
to avoid possible tests fails on other OS.

Huge refactorig for consistent col/row numbering

## Description

Started from simply changing ToALphaString()/TitleToNumber() logic and related fixes.
But have to go deeper, do fixes, after do related fixes and again and again.

Major improvements:

1. Tests made stronger again (But still be weak).
2. ""Empty"" returns for incorrect input replaces with panic.
3. Check for correct col/row/cell naming & addressing by default.
4. Removed huge amount of duplicated code.
5. Removed ToALphaString(), TitleToNumber() and it helpers functions at all,
and replaced with SplitCellName(), JoinCellName(), ColumnNameToNumber(), ColumnNumberToName(), CellNameToCoordinates(), CoordinatesToCellName().
6. Minor fixes for internal variable naming for code readability (ex. col, row for input params, colIdx, rowIdx for slice indexes etc).
7. Excel time conversion bug fixed.

## Related Issue

https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize/issues/349

## Motivation and Context

Only consistent cell addressing was target. But I have a domino effect.

## How Has This Been Tested

New unit test written for any new functions.
Old test updated for edge cases.

All passed.

qax-os/excelize,262244351,358,SetCellFloat to avoid numeric warnings in Excel,"# PR Details

Excel will warn you if a string field holds a numeric value, this
allows the developer to avoid that warning.

Also removed duplicate type assertions in SetCellValue and
setCellIntValue.

## Related Issue

#357 

## Motivation and Context

My users were complaining about the little warning Excel gives if you put numeric values into a cell
as strings. This allowed me to properly set floating point values. Also, removing the duplicate type assertions should help performance.

## How Has This Been Tested

I added a unit test to make sure the value could still be retrieved using `GetCellValue`. I also integrated this change into my application using `gohack` and ensured it generated a valid xlsx document. I unzipped the document to make sure the xml looked like I would expect.

Adding the same image should create a drawing referencing the

## Motivation and Context

This reduces the overall file size if an image is reused. For example, a header might be used frequently in a number of sheets and if the same logo is used this change will make it so only one copy of that logo is saved.

Added a unit test, verified there was no performance regression in the benchmark, and generated

## Description

We don't need to backfill columns into every row for most purposes
Provided makeContiguousColumns for setting styles where we do
need it for a specific region.

Added a benchmark to monitor progress. For 50,000 rows this went
from about 11 seconds to 1 second. The improvements are more
dramatic as the row/column count increases.

## Related Issue

## Motivation and Context

This allows writing much larger files, quickly.

## How Has This Been Tested

This should be transparent but I made sure all the tests pass, added a benchmark, and
created some files to make sure they saved correctly.

qax-os/excelize,271585091,385,refactoring for merge cells.,"# PR Details

Refactoring for merge cells functions.

## Description

Move mergedcell related functions coded in `excelize.go` to `cellmerged.go`.

## Related Issue

None

## Motivation and Context

If add some functions related to merge cell, it causes enlargement of excelize.go.
Also, I want to extend the function, but at that time I need to add the function related to the merged cell.

## How Has This Been Tested

runs unit test.

qax-os/excelize,273598183,391,Add the ability to change the default font,"## Description

This allows users to change the default font of the workbook. I also removed the `scheme` stuff since the library doesn't have an API for themes in it yet and without that they don't appear to impact anything.

In the template I removed the theme reference from the default font and changed the default style name to `Normal` although I don't think that name change was necessary if you preferred the old name.

qax-os/excelize,304102705,456,Fix 439,"## Description

We were parsing the entire sheet twice which was leading to extra memory consumption and parsing time when reading an excel sheet with `Rows()` and `GetRows()`

## Related Issue

#439 

## Motivation and Context

This effectively halves the read time for spreadsheets.

## How Has This Been Tested

All tests continue to pass, and I added a benchmark to validate the performance improvement.
Before:
BenchmarkRows-8   	     500	   2434130 ns/op	  888380 B/op	    8612 allocs/op
OnlyOnce:
BenchmarkRows-8   	    1000	   2123277 ns/op	  811150 B/op	    7173 allocs/op

When run against the data sheet used in #439 the read time went from ~6.4 seconds on my machine to ~3.8 seconds.

## Important!

The one thing I did change is that if you declare a blank Rows struct and immediately call Columns on it you will get an index out of bounds error since you'll be trying to access nothing. However, this didn't seem realistic since users should be getting the rows struct by calling `file.Rows(""someSheet"")` and it works correctly under those conditions. I deleted the part of the test that looked for this behavior. I can add a bounds check to `Columns()` if you prefer but it seems unnecessary to me.

qax-os/excelize,304904121,461,Further improve read performance,"## Description

Instead of re-encoding the full sheet to change the namespaces
in the encoded bytes, read the sheet again and do the byte
replacements there.

In this case, file access ends up being more performant than
marshaling the sheet back to XML.

In the `SharedStrings` test, ensure the strings are actually read.

I actually think this entire operation is unnecessary since we shouldn't be modifying anything on a read but doing the change this way ensures my PR is fully passive in case anyone was relying on the behavior.

## Related Issue

 #439

## Motivation and Context

This further improves the read performance.

After
BenchmarkRows-8   	    1000	   2035770 ns/op	  768284 B/op	    6883 allocs/op

On the test file I was using before this reduced the read time from ~3.8 seconds to ~2.5 seconds.

I ran (and updated) all the unit tests and ran it against the same test files as before.
