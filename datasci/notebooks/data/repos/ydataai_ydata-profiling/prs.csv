```
dates = pd.date_range('20130101',periods=6)

```

This code implements the possibility of specifying a target variable when launching a ProfileReport only by specifying target_name = ""the_target_column_name"". The average value of this target is then plotted on every bins of the histograms. This can help to recognize obvious patterns and correlations only by looking at pandas-profilling results.

This implementation is what I had in mind when I created the issue #10 a long time ago.
I tried to made the changes as minimal as possible. I hope this could finally close this issue!

I also made some changes so that this version is python2 friendly by adding some float() in the current code.

There is still room for improvement in the final visualization but I feel like this could still be very useful for users without any extra cost (if you don't specify a target nothing changes). Let me known if you think that there are improvements that I could do in order to close issue #10.

ydataai/ydata-profiling,324409335,272,PSI estimation for both numeric and categoric features,"This PR adds support for PSI estimation for both numeric and categoric features. Specifically for the following Variable types:

- TYPE_NUM
- TYPE_CAT
- TYPE_BOOL

It also adds an example of its usage using the nza dataset (nza_psi.py, and the generated report nza_report_psi.py). 

A little review of how it is implemented:

- There is an extra configuration parameter, col_split. In order to use PSI estimation, it must be filled
- There are some col_split validations in model/describe.py (if it is not None, it should one of the input df columns, it should have two unique values and also should be bool dtype)
- PSI estimation is added after all previous stats
- If PSI estimation has been used, and the feature type supports it, when rendering the report it captures a different template (row_num_psi.html, row_cat_psi.html, row_bool_psi.html)

Some things to work on after this:
- Add an example with synthetic data that shows clearly what the PSI captures
- When PSI is calculated, add another tab in the toggle details view that shows both distributions
- Review / Add required tests
