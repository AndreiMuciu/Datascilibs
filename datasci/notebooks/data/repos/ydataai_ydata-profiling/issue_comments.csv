Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately, this looks like an issue with that particular Conda distribution. We're not the official maintainers of that channel, and it also appears to be outdated in terms of the available versions.

For the most up-to-date and supported releases, please use our official channel:

This behavior is expected if your dataset doesn't contain any missing values. Could you please confirm and provide more details about your data? If possible, sharing your current data profiling report would help us take a closer look.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
