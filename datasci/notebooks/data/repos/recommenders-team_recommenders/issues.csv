The file [`surprise/similarities.pyx`](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise/blob/master/surprise/similarities.pyx) in the package [`scikit-surprise`](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-surprise/) doesn't work with NumPy 2.x.

recommenders-team/recommenders,2975084313,2219,[FEATURE] Implement R-Precision with PySpark #2087,"### Description
This pull request implements the R-Precision evaluation metric for PySpark within the `SparkRankingEvaluation` class.

This change is required to provide a standard ranking evaluation metric for recommendation models evaluated using PySpark, addressing feature request #2087 and achieving parity with potential implementations for other frameworks (related to #2086). It allows users to measure the fraction of relevant items within the top R recommendations, where R is the total number of relevant items for a user.

### Related Issues

recommenders-team/recommenders,2743865492,2198,[BUG] Direct use of `numba.cuda.gpus` lead to error that module `numba` has no attribute `cuda`,"### Description
After installing `recommenders[gpu]`, doing `len(numba.cuda.gpus)` will lead to the following error

```
>>> len(numba.cuda.gpus)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'numba' has no attribute 'cuda'

Changing to `from numba import cuda` and then `cuda.gpus` will resolve the issue.

recommenders-team/recommenders,2727633406,2194,[BUG] SVAE problems with TypeError: You are passing KerasTensor,"### Description
In the example code examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/standard_vae_deep_dive.ipynb I find an error like this one :
    TypeError: You are passing KerasTensor(type_spec=TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.float32, name=None), name='Placeholder:0', description=""created by layer 'tf.cast_2'""), an intermediate Keras symbolic input/output, to a TF API that does not allow registering custom dispatchers, such as `tf.cond`, `tf.function`, gradient tapes, or `tf.map_fn`. Keras Functional model construction only supports TF API calls that *do* support dispatching, such as `tf.math.add` or `tf.reshape`. Other APIs cannot be called directly on symbolic Kerasinputs/outputs. You can work around this limitation by putting the operation in a custom Keras layer `call` and calling that layer on this symbolic input/output.

I have tried changing the libraries it uses, but I found no solution. The error occurs in the snippet code 
model_without_anneal = StandardVAE(n_users=train_data.shape[0], # Number of unique users in the training set
                                   original_dim=train_data.shape[1], # Number of unique items in the training set

I want to limit each of the computations to 2h, but not all the tests of 1 category. For example, each test process should take less than 2h, but the whole GPU tests can take longer because maybe they are waiting for a free VM.

recommenders-team/recommenders,2587710196,2179,[BUG] ,"### Description
<!--- Describe your issue/bug/request in detail -->

When running the example notebooks provided by the `recommenders` library, specifically when executing the following import statement:

```python
from recommenders.datasets import movielens
```

I encounter an `AttributeError` stating that the module `pandera` has no attribute `SchemaModel`. This error prevents the notebook from running further and seems to be related to the `movielens.py` module within the `recommenders.datasets` package.

The full error message and traceback are provided in the **Other Comments** section below.

### In which platform does it happen?
<!--- Describe the platform where the issue is happening (use a list if needed) -->

- **Platform**:  Databricks
- **Runtime Versions Tried**:
  - Databricks Runtime 11.3 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.3.0, Scala 2.12)
  - Databricks Runtime 12.2 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.3.2, Scala 2.12)
  - Databricks Runtime 13.1 (includes Apache Spark 3.4.1, Scala 2.12)
  - Databricks Runtime 14.1 (includes Apache Spark 3.5.0, Scala 2.12)


Despite trying multiple runtimes, the issue persists across all of them.

### How do we replicate the issue?
<!--- Please be specific as possible (use a list if needed). -->

1. **Set Up  Databricks Environment**:
   - Launch an Databricks workspace.
   - Create a new cluster using any of the runtimes mentioned above.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the `recommenders` library on the cluster:
     ```bash
     pip install recommenders
     ```

3. **Create a New Notebook**:
   - In the workspace, create a new Python notebook attached to the cluster.

4. **Run the Following Code in a Notebook Cell**:
   ```python
   from recommenders.datasets import movielens
   ```

5. **Observe the Error**:
   - The `AttributeError` should occur, indicating that `pandera` has no attribute `SchemaModel`.

### Expected behavior (i.e. solution)

- The import statement `from recommenders.datasets import movielens` should execute without any errors.
- The `movielens` dataset module should be available for use in the notebook.
- All example notebooks using the `recommenders` library should run successfully on Azure Databricks.

**Additional Information**:

- I have verified that `pandera` is installed and up-to-date in the environment:
  ```python
  import pandera
  print(pandera.__version__)   
  ```
- Attempted solutions:
  - Upgrading `pandera` to the latest version did not resolve the issue.
  - Uninstalling and reinstalling `pandera` did not resolve the issue.
  - Downgrading `pandera` to earlier versions leads to other compatibility issues.
- It appears that the `recommenders` library may not be compatible with the latest versions of `pandera`, or there may be an issue with how `SchemaModel` is imported or used in `movielens.py`.

**Environment Details**:

- **Python Version**: 3.10.x (as per the Databricks runtime)
- **recommenders Library Version**: Latest available via `pip` as of the date of this report.

**Request**:

- Guidance on resolving this import error.
- Confirmation on whether this is a known issue or a bug that needs fixing.",ved93,8381908,closed,False,4,2024-10-15T05:48:34+00:00,2024-10-28T15:51:36+00:00,2024-10-28T15:51:35+00:00,bug,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

This PR resolves the issue https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/issues/2171 by updating the testing workflows to use the Azure VM managed identity for login.  It's tested in the PR https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/pull/2174 .

- [ ] Update the doc: tests/README.md
- [ ] **NOTE**: Additional setup is required before this PR is merged:
      1. Create a Azure VM with Ubuntu 22.04
         * Configure the managed identity on creation: Management → Identity → Enable system assigned managed identity
         * Choosee Ubuntu 22.04 instead of 24.04, because PowerShell does not have packages on 24.04
      2. Go to the AML workspace (azureml-test-workspace) and grant the following roles to the VM's managed identity
         * AzureML Compute Operator
         * AzureML Data Scientist
         * Reader
      3. Install [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-ubuntu), [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux) and [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azps-linux) on the VM
      4. Go to [Recommenders](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders) → Settings → Actions → [Runners](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/settings/actions/runners) → New self-hosted runner
Run the command on the VM
      5. Change the following secret values with the IDs of the VM: Settings → Secrets and variables → [Actions](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/settings/secrets/actions) → New repository secret

recommenders-team/recommenders,2552700004,2173,[BUG] Issue with installing the recommenders package while building cornac on macOS ARM64 (M2),"### Description
I am encountering an issue while trying to install the recommenders package on macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon). The error occurs during the cornac building process, specifically while compiling the C++ source files. I've followed the instructions in the GitHub repository and tried installing via both pip and conda, but the issue persists.

### In which platform does it happen?
I am using VSCode as my development environment and have tried multiple approaches, including different compilers and package managers.

### My Setup:
macOS Version: macOS 14.3 (Sonoma)
Python Version: 3.10.12 (installed via pyenv and conda) and tried with 3.9 as well
Compiler:
Tried with clang++ and g++
Also tried Homebrew's LLVM and gcc
Package Managers:
Tried both pip and conda based on the instructions in the GitHub repository.

### Error Details
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef137865-28aa-40ad-9d07-bb9cff200856)

Additionally if I am trying to install through requirements file it fails saying while collecting cornac the dependencies are missing even if they are listed in the requirements file.

recommenders-team/recommenders,2483337644,2154,"[BUG] Ranking Evaluation Metrics Exceed 1 with ""by_threshold"" Relevancy Method","### Description
Hello!

I encountered an issue while evaluating the BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) model with basically the same code provided in the example on a different dataset. Specifically, when using the ""by_threshold"" relevancy method with ranking metrics, the computed values for precision@k, ndcg@k, and map@k exceed 1, which seems incorrect. This issue does not occur when switching the relevancy method to ""top_k.""

### How do we replicate the issue?
I use the following parameter for BPR (all using the default seed):
```
bpr = cornac.models.BPR(
    k=200,
    max_iter=100,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    lambda_reg=0.001,
    verbose=True 
)
```
Using these evaluation
```
TOP_K = 10
threshold =50
eval_map = map_at_k(test, all_predictions, col_prediction=""prediction"",
                    relevancy_method='by_threshold', threshold=threshold, k=TOP_K)
eval_ndcg = ndcg_at_k(test, all_predictions, col_prediction=""prediction"",
                      relevancy_method='by_threshold', threshold=threshold, k=TOP_K)
eval_precision = precision_at_k(
    test, all_predictions, col_prediction=""prediction"",
    relevancy_method='by_threshold', threshold=threshold, k=TOP_K)
```
Here is the dataset I test on:  https://github.com/mnhqut/rec_sys-dataset/blob/main/data.csv

My result: 
MAP:		1.417529
NDCG:		1.359902
Precision@K:	2.256466

recommenders-team/recommenders,2467128668,2146,Updated function signatures to comply with new tensorflow requirements,"### Description
I tried to run the sarsec notebook, but ran into issues because the function calls didn't comply with updated tensorflow requirements.  I fixed the function calls so that they comply with updated requirements.



### Related Issues
If you try running the sarsec notebook with a recent version of tensorflow, the training throws an error because tensorflow modules can only take non-tensor arguments if they are keyword arguments, so the 'training' argument, which is a boolean, throws an error unless it is a keyword argument.

    rr_score = y_true / (np.arange(len(y_true)) + 1)
    return np.sum(rr_score) / np.sum(y_true)
```

I am not sure if I've misunderstood the current implementation, but as far as I can see, it does not account for situations where there are multiple positive examples in one sample:
```
>>> mrr_score([1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0])
1.0
>>> mrr_score([1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0])
0.75
```

Furthermore, according to documentation the input should be ```Predicted labels```, however, we are more interested in the ranking of the positive item in a given sample ([MRR-wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank)).

My suggestion is 
```
def reciprocal_rank_score(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> float:
    order = np.argsort(y_pred)[::-1]
    y_true = np.take(y_true, order)
    first_positive_rank = np.argmax(y_true) + 1
    return 1.0 / first_positive_rank

>>> y_true_1 = np.array([0, 0, 1])
>>> y_pred_1 = np.array([0.5, 0.2, 0.1])
>>> reciprocal_rank_score(y_true_1, y_pred_1)
0.33

>>> y_true_2 = np.array([0, 1, 1])
>>> y_pred_2 = np.array([0.5, 0.2, 0.1])
>>> reciprocal_rank_score(y_true_2, y_pred_2)
0.5

>>> y_true_3 = np.array([1, 1, 0])
>>> y_pred_3 = np.array([0.5, 0.2, 0.1])
>>> reciprocal_rank_score(y_true_3, y_pred_3)
1.0

>>> np.mean([reciprocal_rank_score(y_true, y_pred)for y_true, y_pred in zip([y_true_1, y_true_2, y_true_3], [y_pred_1, y_pred_2, y_pred_3])])
0.611111111111111
```

The original implementation seems correct if asked for the rankings, not the labels for the prediction. When assuming all items are positive, as in my example:
```
mrr_score([1, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1])
0.611111111111111
```
But then, ```y_true``` is not a needed input. 

If I haven't misunderstood and you agree I would be happy to make a PR with suggested improvements.

<!--- Describe your expected feature in detail -->
The pymanopt dependency must currently be installed with an external command, making the setup more difficult. Setup should be transparent to the user and just `pip install recommenders`.

Although the dependency can be included in install_requires, it won't let you upload the recommenders package to pypi.

Nevertheless, pymanopt team doesn't update the pypi package anymore.

`pip install recommenders` just works

- Added some comments on the test README
- Defined some best practices when assert is True

The reasoning is to make the tests more explicit. For example, if a function returns True, we want to make sure the assert checks for True and not for a truthy value. 

Example:
```
result = True
assert result is True  # Passes because result is exactly True

result = 1
assert result  # Passes because 1 is a truthy value
assert result is True  # Fails because 1 is not the exact True object
