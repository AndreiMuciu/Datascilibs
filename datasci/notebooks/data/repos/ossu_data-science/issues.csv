**Duration:**
- 2024 April 28

**Background:**
- It includes a great **visual tool** to visualize all the data structures it covers: https://csvistool.com/
- The TA's for the Princeton courses have **announced they will not** keep supporting students who ask questions on the forums
- Georgia Tech's CS 1332 not only has active TA's in the edX forums but **has a discord server** where one can lean on for help from actual students at GT
- The instructor for all 4 courses, Mary H-B, has great 8-10min videos, and **doesn't read off the slides** (unlike Princeton)
- Princeton _forces_ the student to use the school's **proprietary libraries and download specific IDE's** for their course; OSSU students have complained about this but the people I've heard state their opinions on this are few

**Proposal:**
- The 4 courses are equal to one semester total at Georgia Tech

ossu/data-science,2091003548,116,RFC Add ISL as the cap of the statistics section of OSSU Data Science: ,"**Problem:**
OSSU DS curricula does not currently have a comprehensive course that takes the learned on-paper methods to programmatic assessment using well known programming languages and frameworks. 

**Background:**

The absence of focused statistical learning courses in the OSSU Data Science curriculum results in an incomplete educational journey for students. Future courses are either highly specialized (Andrew Ng) or do not reintroduce learned statistical concepts into programmatic assessment.

The advantages include a more well-rounded curriculum, bridging critical gaps between basic and advanced concepts. However, potential disadvantages might include the need for curriculum restructuring and the additional time commitment for students as well as some overlap with highly specialized courses in the Data Mining section.

**Proposal:**

I'd like to recommend two courses for candidates in our Data Science Statistics program to either end the Statistics section or a new section created called Advanced Statistics with the current set being renamed to core statistics:

[Statistical Learning with Python by Stanford University on EdX](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis-statistics/stanford-university-statistical-learning-with-python)
[Statistical Learning by Stanford University on EdX](https://www.edx.org/learn/statistics/stanford-university-statistical-learning)

Both courses are based on the same content, differing only in the programming language used. They're aligned with a free book available at www.statlearning.com.

These courses offer an extensive introduction to statistical learning methods, crucial for anyone pursuing a career in data science. The authors are renowned figures in the data science community, and this book is frequently recommended on various Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI subreddits.

Why These Courses Are Beneficial:

    Relevance to Data Science: These courses emphasize statistical learning, an essential skill for data analysis and interpretation. They serve as an excellent bridge from basic programming and statistics to advanced model building.

    Curriculum Integration: They address gaps in the current curriculum with a focused approach to statistical learning techniques. It also bridges the gap from Statistics into data mining by building more of the fundamental approaches, programmatically, before specialized attention is given to it later with Andrew Ng's courses.

    Expert Instruction: Taught by leading experts, these courses are acclaimed for their clarity and depth. Larry Wasserman, a respected Professor in Statistics and Machine Learning, endorses the course book.

    Accessibility: Both courses are available for free on the EdX platform, and the book can be downloaded from the course website. Python labs can be found at this GitHub repository, and the course website provides direct files for both R and Python.

    Framework Flexibility: The program offers a choice of frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

    Practical Application: The courses include hands-on exercises and real-world examples, ensuring practical understanding and application.

These courses are an invaluable resource for anyone aspiring to deeply understand and apply data science principles.

ossu/data-science,1899218763,112,RFC: Overhaul Statistics,"## Summary
OSSU should undertake a search for a number of new courses in statistics.
## Background
OSSU currently recommends 2 courses on statistics:
- [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)
- [Intro to Inferential Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)

The first of these is no longer offered.
## Guidelines
OSSU Data Science uses the report [Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-DataScienceGuidelines.pdf) as our guide for course recommendation.

Section 6 ""Transitioning To A Data Science Major Using Typical Existing Courses"" states:
> ...The courses shown in bold are the ten courses that cover the bare minimum of the basic skills needed for data science...

Subsection 6.3 ""Courses in Statistics"" states:
>Content in the Introduction to Statistics course should follow the revised [Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE)](https://www.amstat.org/education/guidelines-for-assessment-and-instruction-in-statistics-education-(gaise)-reports) for college courses
>- **Introduction to Statistics**
>- **Statistical Modeling/Regression**
>- **Machine Learning/Data Mining**
>- Theory of Statistics (requires Probability Theory)
### Gaise
For reference, the [K-12 GAISE](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaiseiiprek-12_full.pdf) report uses a framework of 3 levels of sophistication with stats expected of K-12 students. This can be found on [page 24](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaiseiiprek-12_full.pdf#page=24).

The GAISE [College Report](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf)  includes both goals, recommendations and suggestions for topics that might be omitted.
#### [Goals (summarized)](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf#page=8)
1. Critique stats based results/conclusions.
2. Recognize when statistics would be useful and carry out investigations using stats.
3. Produce graphical displays and numerical summaries. Interpret them.
4. Explain the role of variability in statistics.
5. Explain the central role of randomness in designing studies and drawing conclusions.
6. Use statistical models, including multivariable models.
7. Understand and use hypothesis tests and interval estimation in a multiple of settings.
8. Interpret and draw conclusions from output of statistical software packages.
9. Demonstrate an awareness of ethical issues associated with sound statistical practice.
#### [Recommendations](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf#page=12)
These are largely recommendations for _how_ statistics courses should be taught.
1. Teach statistical thinking
2. Focus on conceptual understanding
3. Integrate real data with a context and a purpose
4. Foster active learning

#### [Suggestions for Topics that Might be Omitted from Introductory Statistics Courses](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf#page=23)
- Probability theory
- Constructing plots by hand
- Basic statistics
- Drills with z-, t-, χ 2 , and F-tables
- Advanced training on a statistical software program

Of note, the basic statistics section reads:
> Histograms, pie charts, scatterplots, means, and medians are now taught in middle and high school and are a prominent part of the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics. Classes taught to adults continuing their education or to students with a different high school background may need to spend a bit more time on basic statistics. No matter the audience, instructors will want to be sure that students truly understand these concepts, but should not dwell on them more than is necessary. Instructors may want to briefly review them to be sure terminology and notation are consistent, but this should take little time.
## Assertions
- OSSU Data Science curriculum should not recommend a descriptive stats course. This is prerequisite material; OSSU's focus is requisite material for undergraduate learners.
- OSSU should identify a suitable Introduction to Statistics course, replacing the two current recommendations
- After identifying the appropriate Introduction to Statistics course, OSSU should determine if a Statistical Modeling/Regression course is necessary. I would be unsurprised if a suitably rigorous Intro Course, paired with our existing ML courses prove sufficient.
- OSSU should identify an optional Theory of Statistics course.
## Request for Comments
This RFC is asking specifically for comments on the assertions above. Are these the right steps? Are there other implications for OSSU's curriculum that are not identified?

There will be other RFCs for carrying out the individual steps (e.g. there will be a separate RFC for Identify an Introduction to Statistics course).",waciumawanjohi,18407643,open,False,8,2023-09-16T00:05:08+00:00,2024-01-10T04:49:10+00:00,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ossu/data-science,941389323,81,RFC: Add python alternative for algorithms course,"**Problem:**
Our curricular guidelines do not require learning multiple languages, but our curriculum asks students to learn a language just to take the algorithms classes.

**Duration:**
2021 Aug 15

**Background:**
Our [curricular guidelines](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-DataScienceGuidelines.pdf) makes only a few references to programming languages. Students are expected to know SQL, the ""language"" of math, and ""**_a_** suitable high-level language"". (emphasis mine) The introductory courses, and most courses, use Python as this high level language.
But students are directed to Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms course, which is taught in Java.

Students have asked for a python alternative in [issues](https://github.com/ossu/data-science/issues/80) and in the discord ([example](https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/744388942635204610/847771614712168498)).

A possible option is the free interactive textbook _[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds3/index.html)_. The book links to [a set of supporting lectures](https://www.youtube.com/c/GerryJenkins/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2). It also has some exercises in the text, which are paired with youtube video solutions. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises; it does not seem that there is an official solution set but some student solutions can be found on github.

This free textbook is used by [dozens of college courses](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Problem%20Solving%20with%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures%20using%20Python%20site%3Aedu). It is well rated by [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=PROBLEM+SOLVING+WITH+ALGORITHMS+AND+DATA+STRUCTURES+USING+PYTHON) and by [pythonbooks](https://pythonbooks.org/topical-books/algorithm-and-data-structure/) (which is really [a measure of popularity on Amazon](https://pythonbooks.org/about/)).

It is not clear that the book is of the same quality as the Sedgwick course. For one, the Sedgewick course provides an autograder. For another, [user ratings of the Sedgewick Algorithms book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10803540-algorithms?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=f3Os932ejV&rank=1) are notably higher.

**Proposal:**
Offer _Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python_ as an alternative Algorithms course for students who want to study in Python.

**Alternatives:**
1. Stick with the status quo.
2. Replace the Sedgewick course rather than offer an alternative.

ossu/data-science,675922484,61,Request for Comments: Data Science Curriculum v2,"**Problem**:
The curriculum has not been maintained and does not represent best practice.

**Duration**:
2020-08-31

**Background**:
OSSU recommends courses that would constitute an undergraduate major in Data Science. It is our responsibility to ensure that we follow best practice. To do so, we must bring the curriculum into alignment with external guidelines. A candidate set of guidelines has been identified and [previously proposed](https://github.com/ossu/data-science/issues/54#issuecomment-612680475).

In 2017, the _Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application_ published the report ""Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science."" The report was authored by “25 undergraduate faculty from a variety of institutions in the United States, primarily from the disciplines of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.” It had a goal of providing “structure for institutions planning for or revising a major in data science.”

The current state of OSSU Data Science is one of disrepair. The curriculum has had 1 change in 3 years. That change deleted a link to a broken application. But there remained many links to courses that are no longer offered. A list of these can be found [here](https://github.com/ossu/data-science/issues/59). Prospective students have [posted in the issues](https://github.com/ossu/data-science/issues/54) asking if the Data Science curriculum is still maintained. Updating the curriculum must ensure that all courses are available for students.

**Proposal**:
OSSU Data Science should adopt “Curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in data science” (CGUPDS) as our guidelines. The curriculum should be updated to match. The exact changes can be reviewed [in this pull request](https://github.com/ossu/data-science/pull/60).
