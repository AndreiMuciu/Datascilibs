> To be prepared for the data science curriculum, students should
>  * Be calculus ready (i.e., have a good precalculus course)
>  * Have an understanding of basic matrix algebra (solving systems of linear equations)
>  * Understand the basics of a relationship between variables, including scatterplots, the idea of correlation, and the line of best fit
>  * Have experience with descriptive statistics: notions of center, spread, and skew

I have found that the current curriculum, starting at MIT 6.000.1x, certainly reflects those prerequisites. Moreover, the previous Readme file included an unused ""Prerequisite"" link in its index, which has now been fixed.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical learning methods and is essential for students pursuing a career in data science.

Rationale:

Relevance to Data Science: Statistical learning is a fundamental aspect of data science, providing the necessary tools for data analysis and interpretation.

Complement Existing Curriculum: This course fills gaps in the current curriculum by offering a focused study on statistical learning techniques.

Quality of Instruction: The course is taught by renowned experts in the field and is well-received by learners for its clarity and depth. Anyone who wants to intelligently analyze complex data should own this book.” Larry Wasserman, Professor, Department of Statistics and Department of Machine Learning, CMU and author of All of Statistics
