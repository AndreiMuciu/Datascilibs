If you would like practice with PRs, or teach your students how to raise PR, you can follow github documentation to create your own repo:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository
And then in that repo practice creating and editing PRs:
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

We look forward to your future contributions to OSSU, when you are contributing to improve data science education for learners all over the world!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
