microsoft/nni,2507248292,5805,About encountering exception while using ConvTranspose2d in nni pruning,"**Describe the issue**:
Report an bug.

When using ConvTranspose2d in config_list to prune my models, I encountered an exception: Unsupported types for ConvTranspose2d.
However, when I check the library files, I see this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d01ac0-3593-4ea6-bc22-8e4d3adf9977)
in nni/compression/speedup/mask_conflict.py, it deals with ConvTranspose2d here,
whereas does not deal with ConvTranspose2d here, which leads to exception for anyone who uses ConvTranspose2d in their codes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eca3bbb-3ade-4a39-9c06-361d8daf606f)
However, I have no idea to solve this by coding myself, so I report a bug here.
Hope to see the solution ASAP, thanks!
