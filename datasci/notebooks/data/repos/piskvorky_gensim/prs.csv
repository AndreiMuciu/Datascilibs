piskvorky/gensim,136662,29,make the root gensim directory a module and add lower dim functionlity,"Hello Radim,

sorry that I did not split this two things in two different branches with independent pull requests. I had this on a local branch and accidentally pushed it already and removing things on a public branch creates only more chaos. 

So what I added in this two commits are all things we already discussed in emails. One thing is to make the top gensim directory a valid module. This is useful when one wants to link this file in the site-packages directory and not the src/gensim directory because the top directory can be checked for version control. 
I checked this new **init** file. It does not break any tests nor the setup.py file

The other thing is that numTopics can be set now to a value lower then the original one in order to evaluate a lower dimensional model. What I did is just a very simple implementation. Is this ok or do you think I should ad getter and setter stuff for numTopics with proper exception handling?

let me know.

I removed the option the stem a substring of a string; it wasn't being used by Gensim and doesn't really make sense. Callers can take a substring themselves.

The stemmer now also does lowercasing itself.

The comments have been stripped of references to pointers and NUL bytes that only made sense in the context of the original C implementation.

piskvorky/gensim,1843198,87,Proper XML parser for Wikipedia dumps,"I've reworked the Wikipedia dump parser in `gensim.corpora.wikicorpus` to use a proper XML parser, instead of the line-oriented parser used now. Experiments on smaller versions of Wikipedia, such as the Norwegian one, show that parsing speed is roughly unchanged.

The main benefit of this approach is that articles can be pruned earlier, e.g. based on the title or the namespace (a user may want to consider only articles from the main namespace, with titles not matching `^List of`, etc.). Also, error handling is improved as the parser checks whether what it gets is XML, and looks like a MediaWiki dump. I think there is also some more room for optimization.

Please let me know what you think.

The `HashDictionary` is based on `Dictionary` and is very similar. The tests are also based on the tests for `Dictionary`. There's a debug option which will keep track of collisions in the hash's range (as sets).

The class `gensim.corpora.RestrictedHash` contains most the logic for imitating the `token2id` dict. The hash function is exposed as a construction argument. The default hash function is `zlib.adler32`, for no particularly good reason. Let me know if you have any feedback!

fscanf (used in the word2vec c code) ignores leading and training whitespace, emulating this behavior in python fixes this issue.

It should replicate the original code by Mikolov et al., except that it combines context words by taking the average of the corresponding vectors instead of their sum. This is in agreement with the textual description of the CBOW model in [1](although Figure 1 in that paper says).

Here are some baseline results on the Google analogy dataset (questions-words.txt) with the vocabulary restricted to the 30,000 most frequent words. The training corpora are the ""text8"" and ""fil9"" datasets found at ""http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html"". In all cases, I used vectors of dimension 640 and a window of size 10. The rest of the hyper-parameters take their default value.

With ""text8"":

Skip-gram: 29.3% correct
CBOW: 15.5% (11.5% if I used the sum of the vectors instead of their average)

With ""fil9"":

Skip-gram: 52.5%
CBOW: 46.2% (29.9% using the sum)

Note: By default, my system always used ""Optimization 1"" during training. What would be the most efficient way to test the other optimizations before incorporating the changes into Gensim?

Changes aim to be backward compatible, but the new official gensim API will recommend **using unicode wherever strings are expected** (now: asks for utf8). Starting with Python 3.3, there's no longer a huge memory overhead to (mostly-ASCII) unicode strings. Python 2 will take a memory hit though.

Highlights:
- All I/O is binary, converted to unicode explicitly inside gensim (=not using the py3k `encoding` params to `open`&co). Uses `utils.smart_open()` consistently.
- All internally stored tokens/keys are expected to be unicode now. Find bytestring/ambiguity => file a bug.
- Need more backward compatibility tests = make sure utf8 inputs continue to work. Don't want the same migration drama py3 itself is having!

piskvorky/gensim,16687187,206,"[word2vec] 'sample' parameter, for frequent-word down-sampling","Implements 'sample' parameter for down-sampling of frequent words. Interpretation of parameter follows original C word2vec formula. (Word frequencies actually need to be about 2.6x the parameter before their odds-of-inclusion fall below 1.0.)

When down-sampling is enabled, the 'total_words' value used for progress-estimation and alpha-updating is an estimate. (So, final progress update my indicate a value over 100%.) Sampling-probabilities for frequent words are precalculated and stored in the Vocab objects to avoid constant recalculation during training. 

Un-sampled words are removed from the sentences, rather than replaced by `None`. Additionally, the handling of out-of-vocabulary words has been changed to remove such words, rather than replace them with `None`. In both cases, this matches my understanding of what the original C word2vec does, and a series of short trials using the 'text8' corpus shows slight accuracy improvements against the question-words.txt accuracy check.

piskvorky/gensim,16915543,208,Support for matrix-valued topic/word prior eta in LdaModel. ,"This allows topics to be seeded with specific words. (Or however you like, really. It could e.g. be used to impose a fixed background topic if you specify the prior for one topic to have a specific base measure and a really high concentration)

This is quite a small patch, it looks like the only place which needs changing to handle a matrix for eta is the computation of the variational bound.

Added a test for the seeding behaviour, although like the existing testTransform test it's just a high-level sanity check.

piskvorky/gensim,17153981,210,Refactor corpus tests,"Also ensures that all possible temp test files are removed

Not a whole lot of changes here, mainly changing CorpusTester to be a concrete class. Needed to do this because some temporary test files were not being removed and could cause multiple test runs to fail.

Just looking for comments & approval before merge.
