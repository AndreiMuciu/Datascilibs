There's probably gonna be a situation where something is in locations but pinned_at_raylet_id is unset or the other way around. I assume this would result in non-critical failure though, just a pull failure or a slightly less accurate locality aware schedule.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

@jjyao actually looks like you did the opposite already here lol, looks like there was an issue due to updating locations through two different sources of truth.

Should close this then, or should we just fully synchronize locations and pinned_at with pinned_at as the source of truth?

Like remove from locations when removing pinned_at and keeping it in location if pinned_at even if obod says to remove?
Main diff is that obod won't report if spilled right.

Either way I feel like we should have a test for the issue described, because this was passing all python tests.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
