Followup to #14734, cc @Carreau 

Following the current doc prints warning:

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/aa25535d3765641e31f1d218537540e41b6f1a74/IPython/__init__.py#L96-L98

(which BTW sounded to me like it was deprecated since 2013 — I assume
the meaning is that `ipykernel.embed` works since 2013?)

----

P.S. Mild argument against the deprecation: IMHO, it's convenient to
remember one place to import both `embed` and `embed_kernel` from. These
are most useful if memorized, so one can type them without thinking,
similar to how we all used to memorize `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
— but became easier to teach with py3.7 `breakpoint()`.

There is no `ipykernel.embed.embed`, and I assume won't be, as it starts
an in-process shell which is _not really a kernel_? But both are
legitimate under `IPython`.

----

There is also a question which package(s) one must install to use these
forms — _and does this need documenting_?

* I see that a clean env `uvx --with ipykernel python` also drags in
IPython as a dependency, so both forms work.
* OTOH `uvx --with IPython python` allows importing IPython but not
ipykernel. In such env, `IPython.embed_kernel()` is **importable but
broken**:
  ```
File
""/home/beni/.cache/uv/archive-v0/_NUp3oIPKrkvaYJk8f7Nm/lib64/python3.13/site-packages/IPython/__init__.py"",
line 110, in embed_kernel
    from ipykernel.embed import embed_kernel as real_embed_kernel
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ipykernel'
  ```
  This was counter-intuitive, and the deprecation avoids that!  
I guess ""install what you import"" is a better quality then my above
concern with ""easy to remember"" :+1:

https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.html#IPython.embed_kernel

### Description:
This PR implements an enhancement to the `%notebook` magic command,
enabling it to optionally save the output, including the MIME types and
exceptions.

### Changes:
Introduced two new dictionaries, `output_mime_bundles` and `exceptions`
in history manager, to store output MIME types and exceptions
separately. This prevents inflating the history.

When the `%notebook` command is invoked, the code extracts MIME types
and exceptions from the `history_manager` and appends them to the
respective output cells in the generated notebook.

### Feedback Request:
Currently, we are using `mime_obj.get_figure()` to retrieve the MIME
data for Matplotlib objects. However, this approach only works for the
figure object. Are there any other approaches to capture MIME data ?

I am using `VerboseTB` to get a structured traceback. While this works
for most errors, it doesn't handle syntax errors and some other edge
cases very well. In `interactiveshell.py`, different types of errors are
handled by using different traceback formats. Should we take the same
approach here to handle different types of exceptions? It might result
in some repetition, but it could improve error reporting for edge cases.",293,34,327,9,"116ee9e50b5d4546f6bb90d39114bb9e313aec19,71862afd721cb9beb1871e4b31de6b40c7643ba5"

Instead of just checking for '.', I've added a new function,
`_determine_completion_context`, to accurately determine whether the
