The idea is basically, being able to create a DAG which allows arbitrary connections between any of the outputs of one Interface to any of the connections of another interface. So you could for example do the following

```python
from gradio import *
io1 = Interface(.., ""audio"", ""text"")
io2 = Interface(.., [""image, ""text""], ""video"")

d = DAG()
d.connect((io1, 0), (io2, 1))  # the text output of io1 is piped as the 2nd input of io2
d.launch()  # will create an [audio, image] --> [video] Interface
```

And there are some additional ideas if you want to fix the input value of an Interface to be constant (so it doesn't appear), or hide an output, you can do that as well.

gradio-app/gradio,779630039,362,Custom Flagging Callbacks & Flagging for Hugging Face Spaces,"Motivation
-----
We would like the FLAG button on Gradio interfaces to be flexible. In particular, on Hugging Face Spaces, the FLAG button should take the sample and save it to a Hugging Face Dataset. This can be useful for collecting data e.g. for building a crowd-sourced dataset of samples on which a machine learning demo makes mistakes.  

Proposal
-------
We create a new `FlaggingCallback` abstract class whose subclasses must define the following two methods:
* `setup(flagging_dir)`
* `flag(self, interface, input_data, output_data, flag_option, flag_index, username)`

The `setup()` method is called once when the `Interface` is launched and can do things like create a directory, while the `flag()` method is what is called when the button is actually called and can do things like append to a CSV file.

The Interface object is constructed (through the `flagging_callback` parameter) with a `FlaggingCallback` object. The default callback is an object of a class known as `CSVLogger` which implements the current behavior of the FLAG button. We also define a `SimpleCSVLogger` for pedagogical reasons. 

Most importantly, we define a new `HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` callback which a user can use to enable the behavior described above (save a flagged sample to a HuggingFace Dataset). In order to do this, a user simply needs to instantiate a `HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` with `hf_foken` (their Hugging Face token, which can be provided through Secrets), and `dataset_name`. The class will take care of the rest utilizing the `hub` API.

This is work in progress -- feedback welcome.

gradio-app/gradio,780529959,364,"Fix comparison of ""numpy"" and ""pil"" types in Image","The line

```

```
elif (self.type == ""numpy"") or (""pil""):
```

where `(""pil"")` is always evaluated as True. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/20002504/50065 for more info.

The reason this wasn't caught by the tests is because they were written like:

```
  with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
      wrong_type = gr.inputs.Image(type=""unknown"")
      wrong_type.preprocess(img)
      wrong_type.serialize(""test/test_files/bus.png"", False)
```

The line `wrong_type.preprocess(img)` would trigger a ValueError and the test would be markes as succeeded, but it obscures that the line `wrong_type.serialize(""test/test_files/bus.png"", False)` would fail with:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
