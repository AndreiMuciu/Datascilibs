AMAI-GmbH/AI-Expert-Roadmap,2499064069,87,Suggestion to Add an NLP (Natural Language Processing) Roadmap,"To whom it may concern,

Thank you for maintaining this excellent AI Expert Roadmap! I have found it extremely valuable in guiding my learning journey. 

I would like to suggest the addition of a dedicated roadmap for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Given the growing importance of NLP in AI, a specialized roadmap would greatly benefit those of us looking to deepen our expertise in this area. It could include key topics such as language models, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, transformers, large language models, and more.

This would be a great enhancement to the current roadmap, helping learners navigate the complex landscape of NLP more effectively.

Thank you for considering this suggestion!

AMAI-GmbH/AI-Expert-Roadmap,1584792653,75,"Symbolic AI, Neuro Symbolic Reasoning and Knowledge Engineering subfields are missing","Hi AMAI Team,

I wanted to start by commending you on the great work you have produced. However, it appears m to me that certain aspects and technologies crucial to important AI subfields like Symbolic/Neuro-Symbolic AI and Knowledge Engineering have been missed. These areas of study are becoming increasingly important in the development of AI systems, as they focus on creating knowledge-based systems that can reason and learn from symbolic representations of information.

Symbolic AI involves the use of logical and linguistic structures, such as description logics and NLP techniques, to represent knowledge and manipulate it to solve problems. Unlike recent AI approaches that rely on statistical methods and machine learning, incorporating symbolic AI techniques enables AI systems to reason logically and make inferences based on the rules and relationships within the knowledge base.

In the case of Neuro-Symbolic AI, symbolic reasoning and neural network-based learning are integrated at multiple levels, including the use of embeddings and graphs techniques to combine neural networks with rule-based systems, incorporating symbolic reasoning into deep learning models, and using neural networks to learn the structure of symbolic knowledge. The aim is to create AI systems that can reason about complex, abstract concepts and learn from experience in an efficient and interpretable manner. Moreover, this direction can provide answers for more explainable AI systems and act as a bridge between big AI subfields.

Knowledge Engineering, on the other hand, is focused on creating and managing knowledge in AI systems. This involves developing methods to represent knowledge in machine-readable forms such as RDF, OWL ontologies, and knowledge graphs (Semantic Web Stack), as well as using or creating tools and techniques to manage, maintain, and update this knowledge over time, such as RDF stores, SPARQL endpoints, and graph databases. By applying knowledge engineering principles, AI systems can better leverage the knowledge they have acquired and make more informed decisions.

While the work you have presented is undoubtedly impressive, incorporating principles and technologies from these subfields into your roadmap would help ensure a more complete picture for AI systems that can capture, learn, adapt  and reason. I hope this feedback proves useful for your future endeavors.

When really data scientist, ML scientist, and DL researchers share similar skills as well as having their very own unique skills that other roles might not have. For example, data scientists might be more business-oriented, ML/applied scientists might work closely on applied research/engineering to make sure the developed ML models go into production, and DL researchers might work more on the pure research side. In no way is one job on higher seniority than the other in terms of skills, years of experience, and even education level (although DL researchers typically have PhD more often than ML scientists and data scientists).",localminimum,38855518,open,False,1,2021-05-19T11:39:06+00:00,2021-05-19T11:40:38+00:00,,,6,6,0,0,0,0,0

AMAI-GmbH/AI-Expert-Roadmap,739613697,12,Change the order of the EDA/Data wrangling section and add a few missing things to other parts ,"Hi all, this is a very nice chart but I believe that there should be slight modifications. 

**Data Science Roadmap**


""Dimensionality and Numerosity Reduction"" is a large topic which would include the study of the ""Principal Component Analysis"" (PCA) algorithm as the very first thing you'd do. Yet PCA is seen as being the very final thing you look at in this section. I think you should put PCA right before Dimensionality Reduction or you should combine them. 

In the ""Visualization section"" you list some nice plotting libraries, but I think that [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)  should be included here because it is a superior python plotting library (out of the box GPU/OpenGL support allowing for plotting millions of points, significantly more flexible interaction system) combined to the other options and is quickly becoming one of the important graphing libraries. 

Under ""Data Sources"" you may want to put ""Data Mining and Web Scraping"" or something along those lines since I think a Data Scientist should be able to get their own data rather than go on Kaggle or github awesome pages. 


**Machine Learning Roadmap**

Subsections under ""Association Rule Learning"" should be ""Apriori algorithm"", ""ECLAT algorithm"" and ""Fp-trees"" 

Subsections under Dimensionality Reduction should include (after PCA): ""Random Projection"", ""NMF"", ""T-SNE"", ""UMAP"" 

Subsections under Clustering should include (after Agglomerative): ""OPTICS"" and ""HDBSCAN""

Subsections under ""Classification"" should include ""Guassian Mixture Models"" 

Logistic Regression is actually a binary classification algorithm, despite its name, so move it from regression to Classification

Moving Huggingface Transformers out from here and into the Deep Learning section.

**Deep Learning Roadmap**

Add a new section under ""Architectures"" called ""Attention Mechanisms/Transformers""
Add a new section under Architectures called ""NEAT/Evolving Architectures"" 


**Big Data Engineer**

Add a new blue section under ""Tools"" for Dask, Numba, Onnx, and OpenVino
