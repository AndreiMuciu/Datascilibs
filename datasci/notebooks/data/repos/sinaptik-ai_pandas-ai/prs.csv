this PR aims at addressing #53.

## Changelog:
- google-palm becomes an optional dep, installable via `poetry install --extras google` or `pip install pandasai[google]` or `poetry install --all-extras`. Reference: [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#extras)
- the test workflow installs also the optional dependencies to appropriately run all the tests.

Results that have a dataframe (with or without index) will be returned as dataframe instead of a string.
