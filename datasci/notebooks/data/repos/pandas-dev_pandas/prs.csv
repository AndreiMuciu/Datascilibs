pandas-dev/pandas,201967,55,Minor change to CleanCommand so build works with stdeb,"Hi Wes, i've been following your pandas work for a while, and regularly install it on my ubuntu based systems.  I generally use the stdeb (https://github.com/astraw/stdeb) package for creating .deb files from python packages.  Unfortunately, some of your recent changes in setup.py in pandas caused a problem with building using stdeb.  Essentially the problem is that debhelper tries to run ""python setup.py clean -a"" at some point, which doesn't work because the customized clean command does not have a ""-a"" option.  I just added a dummy argument ""--all, -a"" argument that has no effect.

No worries if you'd rather not merge it, just wanted to check.

pandas-dev/pandas,334822,146,Minor change to csv reading,"Hi Wes

Firstly, congrats on such an amazing project! I love prototyping in python / numpy / ipython, but I always envy some of R's features. I tried pandas out about 9 months ago and although it was interesting, it seemed very rough around the edges. Now, however, it is looking really polished and I've been using it for prototyping and testing some trading models, and everything works extremely well. I hope it keeps growing, together with the integration with scikits statsmodels/timeseries and maybe even scikits.learn in future ...

Anyway, as I was starting to dive into the code, I came across the <code>read_csv</code> functions and noticed that there was full duplication in <code>read_table</code>. The <code>csv</code> module in python actually has full support for arbitrary delimiters, so there is no need for the duplication. Also, there is <code>csv.Sniffer().sniff(sample)</code> that attempts to sniff out the delimiter automatically. This commit tries to ""magically"" handle any arbitrary CSV file without needing to specify a separator, whether separated by blank spaces, tabs, commas, semicolons or other weird separators (I have a file at work with ""^"" separators :). If it doesn't work, one can fall back on specifying the separator (so <code>read_csv</code> looks more like <code>read_table</code>). In future it could make sense to simply have one <code>read_data</code> or <code>read_table</code> function.

Incidentally, the <code>csv.Sniffer()</code> also tries to sniff out other things like quote escaping and double quoting, but this commit effectively only uses it for the delimiter. If problems with quote / string escaping crop up with users one could always let the sniffer try to figure out the full dialect.

Thinking about adding DataFrameGroupBy.boxplot(), now this call is transfered to DataFrame.boxplot().
But i would prefer the behavior to be different. When groupby is used i`m interested to see in a single plot boxplots for one particular column for all groupby keys and not in one plot to have boxpots for all columns for one groupby key. An input argument can be used to so both ways of boxplotting can be used.

pandas-dev/pandas,618130,515,various HDFStore fixes regarding tables,"commit d1f439c: added optional keyword argument 'itemsize' to HDFStore.put and HDFStore.append to control string length; default 255

it sets the string length of strings in the index and columns for the table (rather than the previous behavior, which was to take the max string length from the longest index/column string in the dataset that is used to create the table). Default is 255.

commit 2b13848: nicer error message for store.put('ccc', DataFrame(['hi'], ['a'], ['col']), table=True); also fixes a bug in d1f439

commit 2bce685: before this commit, the following would discard column1:
store.put('eee', DataFrame([0], ['a'], ['column1'])); store.append('eee', DataFrame([1], ['a'], ['column2'])); store['eee']
even with this commit, strings such as column names which are longer than ""itemsize"" and which are .appended in the future will be silently truncated. I recommend that a warning be raised when this happens, but i didn't add that myself because i couldn't easily find the place where the truncation occurs, or how to extract the current string length.

i'm having trouble building so i won't be able to try writing unit tests. however, here are tests for these commits:

from pandas import *; store = HDFStore('test.h5')

store.put('ccc', DataFrame(['hi'], ['a'], ['col']), table=True); 
 # should raise ""TypeError: At this time, Pandas HDFStore tables only support floating point values.""

store.put('fff', DataFrame(['0'], ['a'], ['column1'])); store.append('fff', DataFrame([1], ['a'], ['column2'])); 
 # should raise ""ValueError: Can only append to Tables""

store.put('fff', DataFrame([0], ['a'], ['column1']), table=True); store.append('fff', DataFrame([1], ['a'], ['column2'])); store['fff']
 # should yield
 #    column1  column2
 # a  0        1  
 #   (this was true even before the present commits)

store.append('j', DataFrame([0], ['a'], ['column1'])); store.append('j', DataFrame([1], ['a'], ['column2'])); store['j']

pandas-dev/pandas,653408,574,implemented description property,"Hi,

This is a basic implementation of description and unit properties in DataFrame. 
https://github.com/wesm/pandas/issues/39

I used dict to store both description and unit. I thought about using tuples but dict would be better if a user wants to modify individual descripition/unit. 

One can directly access description/unit, and also DataFrame.info() will print out those if they exist.

I haven't touched at the storing part yet so it is very rudimentary now (no way to save the descriptions), but I wanted to know what you think. Please let me know.

And also, is this (topic branch) right way to submit a pull request? I'm still learning about git. :)

Happy new year!
-Joon
