This PR remove the two `st.set_page_config` restrictions:
- It can only be called as the first `st` command (with some exceptions)
- It can only be called once per script run
The properties are additive (if the first call sets a `page_title` and the second call sets a `page_icon`, the page now has both the provided title & icon). This also applies for `menu_items`.",166,127,293,9,48250df4f5206e3670f351ff28b53759097d9eef
