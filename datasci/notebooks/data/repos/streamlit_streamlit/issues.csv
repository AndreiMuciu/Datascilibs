streamlit/streamlit,3057213374,11330,"st.context.timezone becomes empty str ("""") after reloading new saved changes","### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

When using `st.context.timezone` in a Streamlit app, the component initially returns the correct timezone string of the user's browser.
However, after making any change to the associated `.py` files and saving them, the page refreshes automatically, causing `st.context.timezone` to become `""""`.
If you refresh the page by interacting with other Streamlit components, like a button, it recovers it's initial correct state.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title=""Streamlit App"",
)

st.write(f""Timezone: {type(st.context.timezone).__name__}, {st.context.timezone}"")
st.write(st.context.timezone == """")
st.button(""Click me!"")
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a Streamlit app with the provided code snippet.
2. Run the app and observe that `st.context.timezone` returns the correct timezone string (e.g., Europe/Madrid).
3. Make any change to the `.py` file, such as adding a blank line, and save the file.
4. Observe the automatic page refresh and check the value returned by `st.context.timezone`.
5. Click the button or refresh the page to recover the initial correct timezone.

### Expected Behavior

After making changes to the `.py` files and saving them, the page should refresh automatically, and `st.context.timezone` should consistently return the correct timezone string of the user's browser.

### Current Behavior

After saving changes to the `.py` files, the page refreshes automatically, causing `st.context.timezone` to return `""""`. 
The correct timezone is restored by the page.

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Summary

**Subject: Application Not Starting - ""The main module file does not exist"" Despite File Presence**

Hello,

I'm experiencing a critical issue with my Streamlit Cloud application that fails to start properly.

**Problem Description:**
- Application URL: [your-streamlit-app-URL]
- Error message: ""The main module file does not exist: /mount/src/mja-poc-oc-p9/app.py""
- The app.py file definitely exists at the root of my GitHub repository and is correctly configured
- I've verified the project structure, all necessary files are present
- I've attempted multiple restarts/redeployments without success

**Technical Details:**
- GitHub Repository: [your-repo-URL]
- Project structure: app.py is present at the root, with models/ and utils/ folders correctly configured
- Logs show that Streamlit cannot find the app.py file although it's visible in GitHub
- I'm using Python 3.x with TensorFlow/Keras to load an ML model from Hugging Face

**What I've Already Tried:**
- Restarting the application from the dashboard
- Forcing redeployment via minor commits
- Checking all configuration parameters
- Using optimized code to load the model with TFSMLayer

**Suspicions:**
There seems to be a synchronization issue between GitHub and Streamlit Cloud, or a caching problem preventing Streamlit from finding my app.py file.

Could you please help me resolve this issue so my application can start properly?
FYI : My app is working well locally in my VM Linux
Thank you in advance,
[Your name]

streamlit/streamlit,3054270018,11319,Allow callbacks after login to get additional user info,"## Describe your changes
Call user-provided callbacks after login to get additional user data. 

Some providers do not provide the needed data the way Streamlit implements the login flow (for example Discord, which needs the _/users/@me_ endpoint to be called after authorization, even if the `identify` scope is requested).

With this change, the user can provide a list of additional callbacks in the `secrets.toml` to be called and the data will be added to the `st.user` dict. 

This implementation allows to avoid returning the access token to the user, as it seems Streamlit want to avoid that for security reasons.

Example of `secrets.toml`:

```toml
[auth]
redirect_uri = ""...""
cookie_secret = ""...""

[auth.discord]
client_id = ""...""
client_secret = ""...""
server_metadata_url = ""https://discord.com/.well-known/openid-configuration""
client_kwargs = {""prompt"" = ""none"", ""scope"" = ""openid identify"", ""callback_endpoints_to_call"" = ""[{'method': 'get',  'endpoint': 'https://discord.com/api/users/@me'}]""}
```

Example response without this implementation:

```json
{
    ""is_logged_in"":true,
    ""iss"":""https://discord.com"",
    ""aud"":[
        ""...""
    ],
    ""iat"":""..."",
    ""exp"":""..."",
    ""auth_time"":""..."",
    ""nonce"":""..."",
    ""at_hash"":""..."",
    ""sub"":""...""
}
```

Example response wit this implementation:

```json
{
    ""is_logged_in"":true,
    ""iss"":""https://discord.com"",
    ""aud"":[
        ""...""
    ],
    ""iat"":""..."",
    ""exp"":""..."",
    ""auth_time"":""..."",
    ""nonce"":""..."",
    ""at_hash"":""..."",
    ""sub"":""..."",
    ""id"":""..."",

    ""locale"":""..."",
    ""premium_type"":""..."",

    ""verified"":""..."",
}
```

I wanted to implement something like providing callback functions when calling `st.login` but I'm not familiar with the implementation (I mean working with `ForwardMsg` and context), so I fell back to this option.

### Summary

I seem to have found an instance where the return value of st.button() depends on the value of its ""help"" parameter, which should never happen.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
# Import Streamlit.
import streamlit as st

# Here's the problem.
st.write('If you press the button twice in a row, then the first time you do that (as long as you haven\'t pressed the button before), it will register as False on the second press. But it should always register as whether the button has been pressed (True if pressed, False if not [such as when you hit the ""r"" key]). Bottom line: The button\'s value should not depend on the help text.')

# Name for the session state key.
key = 'my_key'

# Help text for the button.
button_help_text = st.session_state[key] if key in st.session_state else None

# Define the button.
my_button = st.button('press me', help=button_help_text)  # this shows the bug
# my_button = st.button('press me')  # this works

# Write the values of the button help text and the value of the button itself.
st.write('button_help_text:', button_help_text)
st.write('my_button value:', my_button)

# If the button has been pressed, initialize the session state value of the key to ""hello"".
if my_button:
    num = 4
    st.session_state[key] = 'hello'  # commenting this out fixes the issue too
```

### Steps To Reproduce

Run the app and press the button twice in a row. The second time, it will register as False, as printed to the screen.

Then comment out the first ""my_button = "" line and uncomment out the second one, which has no ""help"" parameter. Then, pressing the button twice in a row correctly shows True and True.

### Expected Behavior

The button should always write True or False depending on whether it was pressed or not. If this particular ""help"" parameter is used, this does not occur.

### Current Behavior

See above.

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- Streamlit version: 1.45.0
- Python version: 3.11.7
- Operating System: WSL2

Activates the [flake8-simplify (SIM)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-simplify-sim) linting rule set via ruff. This provides a couple of rules to simplify some common patterns. 

I deactivated a couple of rules that seemed slightly too opinionated; the other rules look reasonable and can be auto-fixed.

streamlit/streamlit,3050831978,11312,Color Specifications Not Maintained When Using add_rows() Method with Line Charts,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

I have identified an inconsistency in how Streamlit's line charts handle color specifications when using the two-step process of creating an empty chart with color parameters and subsequently adding data via the `add_rows()` method. While colors are correctly applied when creating a chart with complete data in a single step, these color specifications are not maintained when using the dynamic `add_rows()` approach.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# Initialize empty chart with specific colors
st.write(""Creating chart with colors: Training=#FF0000, Validation=#0000FF"")
loss_chart = st.line_chart(
    pd.DataFrame({
        'Training Loss': [],
        'Validation Loss': []
    }), 
    color=[""#FF0000"", ""#0000FF""]
)

# Create sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Training Loss': [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5],
    'Validation Loss': [1.0, 0.85, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65]
})

# Add data to chart
loss_chart.add_rows(data)
```

### Steps To Reproduce

The code demonstrates the issue

### Expected Behavior

The line chart should display two lines with the specifically assigned colors:
- ""Training Loss"" line in red (#FF0000)
- ""Validation Loss"" line in blue (#0000FF)

### Current Behavior

When using the `add_rows()` method, the chart reverts to default colors instead of maintaining the colors specified during chart initialization.

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- Streamlit version: 1.45.0
- Python version: 3.12
- Operating system: MacOS 15.4.1
- Browser: Safari and Chrome


### Additional Information

Consider implementing persistence of styling parameters, particularly color assignments, when the `add_rows()` method is used. This would create consistency between the single-step and two-step approaches to chart creation and population.",Vangalle,65287607,open,False,1,2025-05-09T05:01:25+00:00,2025-05-09T18:15:05+00:00,,type:bug;status:confirmed;priority:P3;feature:builtin-charts,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

This change migrates away from fzy.js to vendored code with small modifications/improvements including types, and handling case sensitivity (It's MIT licensed).

Also minor, but the sorting for the options is using the negative filter rather than reversing the list. This keeps the sorting more stable and not move options completely around (minor perf benefit).

streamlit/streamlit,3048643469,11302,Add safeguard for cached messages cleanup,"## Describe your changes

There seems to be an error case with the new forward message cache, resulting in a cache miss. One theory why this might happen:

1. User triggers rerun (with cache message A)
2. Frontend receives finished message from the previous rerun -> cleaning up cached message A
3. Frontend receives new session message from new rerun
4. Frontend receives reference message for message A -> crash

This PR would prevent this issue by ignoring the finished message from the previous script run. 

There is another potential error scenario:
 1. User triggers rerun 1 (with cache message A) 
 2. User triggers rerun 2 (with cache message A)
 3. Frontend receives new session message for rerun 1
 4. Frontend receives finished message for rerun 1
 5. Frontend receives new session message for rerun 2
 6. Frontend receives finished message for rerun 2

However, I'm not sure if this scenario is feasible. It would require very fast user interactions paired with very fast script executions.

### Summary

[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-11299)

This is a very easy to reproduce bug.  If it matters we have a almost 100k row dataframe.

There is a slider:
rows_to_show = st.slider(""Rows to show"", min_value=10, max_value=100, value=20, step=10)

Which adjusts the height of the df:
st.dataframe(df, height=40 + (rows_to_show * 30)) # <- yes a little math voodoo

However, if you adjust the height and then re-adjust the height (or slider) prior to the dataframe finish loading, this error is thrown. 

For now, I will hard code a frame height. 

Issue raised in webpage:
Failed to process a Websocket message. Error: Cached ForwardMsg MISS [hash=918983c443e8f49e31d63646dea52973]. This is not expected to happen.

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.
- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.

### Summary

Today, Streamlit automatically reruns when you change certain config options in `.streamlit/config.toml` (e.g. for theming). But it doesn't rerun when a config file is first created. Instead, you need to reboot the server in order for the config file to be recognized. We should handle that automatically!

### Why?

The current behavior is annoying and can be confusing for new users. 

### How?

If no config file exists, look for it, and when a new one is created, automatically rerun the app and apply the options as much as possible.

Enforces the correct usage of python typing annotations by:

This PR also adds typing annotations wherever it was missing. The next step is to prevent fully untyped methods by setting `ignore-fully-untyped = false` in the Ruff config and to activate type checking via mypy in the `e2e_playwright` folder.

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.
- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.

### Summary

I would like to propose (and implement) an additional option to the `NumericColumn` formatter for `file_size`.  The proposed option would convert `1200000` into `1.2 MB`.  

### Why?

I am using Streamlit to present data which contains data volumes and I would like to be able to render them using human readable formats.

### How?

I would like to add a new option of `file_size` to the formats available in the `NumericColumn`.

This PR remove the two `st.set_page_config` restrictions:
- It can only be called as the first `st` command (with some exceptions)
- It can only be called once per script run

The properties are additive (if the first call sets a `page_title` and the second call sets a `page_icon`, the page now has both the provided title & icon).
This also applies for `menu_items`.

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.
- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.

### Summary

If you change any parameter of a widget in Streamlit (e.g. the label or the default value), Streamlit will treat it as a new widget and reset its state. That’s necessary because we determine which widget state belongs to which widget based on the parameters. (Note that there are a few exceptions to this rule, e.g. changing the `disabled` parameter will not reset the widget). 

But we still do this when you manually set `key`! Even though in that case, we can easily associate the widget state with the widget based on the `key`. We should change that and always preserve the widget identity if `key` is set. 

### Why?

This (potentially) fixes lots of small issues such as:

- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9402
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11268
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9415
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7749
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10843
- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10181
- With zoom events on charts/maps, this could unblock use cases where you dynamically want to load data while zooming in.

### How?

We need to be careful here since this *might* break apps. Probably needs a bit of investigation.

streamlit/streamlit,3040617921,11276,[BUG]: streamlit plolty bar graph point selection giving wrong values for x and label,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

I'm plotting a `group` bar chart using plotly. It has 3 columns, namely `Date`, `Value1` and `Value2`. `Date` is on `x-axis` while `Value1` and `Value2` are plotted as group bars on `y-axis`. If I enable `on_select='rerun'` and `selection_mode='points'`, the selected points are giving the wrong value for `x` and `label`. On selection of the chart, the returned values have the following issues:
1. It automatically converts `date` to `datetime` and adds hour and minutes as `14:24`
2. It gives random month day for the selected bar e.g. if I select 2025-07-31 on the bar, it will return `x` as 2025-08-05 14:24. This is very weird because this date is not even in the dataframe. 
3. The return data type is `str` while the `x-axis` is `date`
4. The values on the plolty bar chart are showing correctly but the returned values for `x` and `label` are different

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np

if 'value1' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['value1'] = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=20)
    st.session_state['value2'] = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=20)
    
df = pd.DataFrame({})
df['date'] = pd.date_range(start='2025-01-01', periods=20, freq='ME').date
df['value1'] = st.session_state['value1']
df['value2'] = st.session_state['value2']
c1, c2 = st.columns([1, 1], gap='small', vertical_alignment='bottom')
c1.dataframe(df, height=200, use_container_width=True, hide_index=True)
fig = px.bar(df, x='date', y=['value1', 'value2'], barmode='group', height=300, text_auto=True, color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Bold)

### Summary

I have made a simple markdown editor. The problem is that for first time it edits. but then second time edit is overlooked and third time, it is edited. This alternating overlooked and edit cycle then continues.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(page_title=""Markdown Previewer"", layout=""wide"")
st.title(""Markdown Previewer"")


if st.session_state.get(""text_md"", None) is None:
    st.session_state.text_md = ""## first delete this line, press ctrl+enter, it works"" \
    ""\n\n## then, delete this line, wont work, try again, will work"" \
    ""\n\n## pattern is similar, one time not work, next time work, and repeat"" \
    ""\n\n## thank you for helping 👏 \n ""

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.subheader(""Markdown Input"")
    st.session_state.text_md = st.text_area(label=""markdown input"", height=500, value=st.session_state.text_md,
                                    label_visibility=""collapsed"")
    # need st.session_state.text_md as will be used in the next page

with col2:
    st.subheader(""Markdown Output"")
    st.markdown(st.session_state.text_md)
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. run script
2. in text area, delete first line, press ctrl+enter or click else where, it works
3. then delete second line and ctrl+enter, this will be overlooked
4. do above step again, this time edited
5. pattern is:  one time edit overlooked, next time works, and this alternating behavior repeats

### Expected Behavior

text in text_box is modified every time

### Current Behavior

one time edit overlooked, next time work, and behavior repeats

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- Streamlit version: 1.45.0, 1.44.1
- Python version: 3.13.3
- Operating System: win10
- Browser: firefox

streamlit/streamlit,3040494447,11274,Persist search keyword in multiselect filter for easy selection,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.
- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.

### Summary

In the multi-select component, when we use the keyword search to search through a lot of options, it clears the search when a value is selected. Ideally, that search and keyword is persisted until the user clears it themselves (either using the delete bar or a little ""x"" button) so that we don't need to retype the keyword every single time for every single selection.

### Why?

The motivation is to reduce tedious redundant work. If we want to select similar components that are tagged a certain way (i.e. our campaign naming have a similar taxonomy), it takes forever to select all the campaigns we want quickly.

streamlit/streamlit,3038969296,11268,selectbox selection is discarded when format_func output changes,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

Streamlit selectbox gets re-created when formatted labels change, discarding user output.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st
import time

if ""start_time"" not in st.session_state:
  st.session_state[""start_time""] = time.time()

start_time = st.session_state[""start_time""]

option = st.selectbox(
  label=""Option"",
  options=[""A"", ""B"", ""C""],
  format_func=lambda option: f""{option}: {int(time.time()-start_time)} seconds ago"",
  key=""option"",
  index=None
)

st.write(""Option"", option)
```

### Steps To Reproduce


**Example usecase**: Selectbox includes formatted dates like ""My Option | 5 minutes ago"". As time passes, these labels change. When user tries selecting one of the options, it discards their selection. The annoying part about this is that it only happens *sometimes* (when the time crosses the minute mark) so developers might have troubles debugging the source of the issue.

1. Run the example app
2. Select any of the options - the selection gets discarded

### Expected Behavior

**Proposed solution 1**: Do not re-create the selectbox if `options` stay the same and only `format_func` output changes.

**Proposed solution 2**: Update the selectbox documentation with a warning about this. Currently the documentation for `format_func` says: ""This has no impact on the return value of the command."" which I would say is incorrect in this case :)

### Current Behavior

User's selection gets discarded when `format_func` output changes.

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- Streamlit version: any
- Python version: any
- Operating System: any
- Browser: any

streamlit/streamlit,3038477000,11266,Rerun() inside an st.fragment resets widget values to defaults.,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

When `rerun()` is called inside a fragment, it resets assigned values and session_state of contained input widgets to defaults.

E.g., for the attached code, when you click the ""rerun"" button, both _displayed_ values of `t` change to ""foo"", regardless of what was entered in the text box. Also, if no default is provided for the input, it resets to an empty string.

Note that if `rerun()` is called _after_ the input widget, everything works as expected.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st

@st.fragment()
def toggle_and_text():
    if st.button(""rerun""):
        st.rerun()
    t = st.text_input(""Enter t:"",value='foo', key='t')
    st.info(f't = {t}')

toggle_and_text()
st.header('Outside Fragment')
st.info(f'session_state_t = {st.session_state.t}')
st.button(""Update"")
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the example code
2. Change the text input value
3. Click ""rerun""
4. The value displayed changes back to ""foo""

### Expected Behavior

The widget input state should not change when doing a rerun()

### Current Behavior

Widget input assigned values and state are reset to defaults when doing a rerun() inside a fragment, _unless rerun() appears after the widget_.

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

On the latest version of streamlit, I noticed the st.file_uploader started erroring out despite us not changing the codes in the last 4 months. So I tested and ran the code using 1.45.00 and got the following error

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3cb0efc-5dda-40f9-94c5-daa7fc8b4ec9)

I reran my code using 1.44.00 and the file_uploader worked without an issue. 

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st

# File uploader allows user to add file
st.subheader('Step 1: Upload File')
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader('Choose a text file', type='txt')
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. pip install streamlit==1.45.00
2. run streamlit 
3. Upload a txt file.

### Expected Behavior

Without bugs, file is processed and uploaded to streamlit without any errors/issues.

streamlit/streamlit,3036275374,11256,st.dataframe() crashes when switching between DataFrames of different sizes,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

When switching between two different `st.dataframe()` tables using a `st.radio()` or `st.selectbox`, Streamlit crashes with a frontend error:  
`TypeError: this.addedRows[(n - this.numRows)] is undefined`.  
This issue occurs specifically when toggling between larger and smaller DataFrames. Wrapping the `st.dataframe()` inside a `st.container()` consistently prevents the crash, suggesting a bug in the component's dynamic re-rendering or virtualization logic.


### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df_a = pd.DataFrame({""A"": list(range(100)), ""B"": list(range(100))})
df_b = pd.DataFrame({""X"": [""a""] * 3, ""Y"": [""b""] * 3, ""Z"": [""c""] * 3})

df_choice = st.radio(""Choose dataset"", [""A"", ""B""])

if df_choice == ""A"":
    st.dataframe(df_a)
else:
    st.dataframe(df_b)  # this triggers the frontend crash after switching

# No issue when wrapped:
# with st.container():
#     st.dataframe(df_b)
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Display a wide DataFrame using `st.dataframe()`.
2. Use `st.radio()` or `st.selectbox()` to switch the view to a smaller DataFrame.
3. The app crashes and the browser console logs the error:
   `TypeError: this.addedRows[(n - this.numRows)] is undefined`.


### Expected Behavior

`st.dataframe()` should safely re-ender regardless of changes in DataFrame size or structure between selections

### Current Behavior

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8786de90-f0f8-4fb6-8fff-5bb950c77ac2)

When navigating from a larger st.dataframe() to a smaller one using a st.radio() or st.selectbox(), the app crashes and throws a frontend JavaScript error.

<pre> text TypeError: this.addedRows[(n - this.numRows)] is undefined  </pre>

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- **Streamlit version:** 1.44.0
- **Python version:** 3.11.0
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Browser:** Firefox (latest)

### Additional Information

### Additional Information

- The error appears **only when switching between two `st.dataframe` views**, particularly from one using `st.dataframe(df)` to another that also uses `st.dataframe(df)` but with different shape or structure.
- When switching from a view that includes a Plotly chart (`st.plotly_chart(...)`) **before** the `st.dataframe`, the issue **does not** occur.
- Wrapping the `st.dataframe(...)` in a `with st.container():` block appears to mitigate the issue entirely.
- The error trace is:

### Summary

Hi, 

Trying to test a nav bar component before implementing it in an app im working on.
Very similar ""bug"" to #8103 but i have tried a bunch of the suggestions on that thread and on others with similar issues relating to switch_page functionality; to no avail.


### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_navigation_bar import st_navbar

nav = st_navbar(pages=[""Home"", ""Test 1"", ""Test 2""])
#
import os

# Attempt with page_link
base_dir = os.getcwd()
test_1 = os.path.join(base_dir, ""pages"", ""test1.py"")
st.page_link(test_1, label=""Test 1"", icon=""📌"")


# Attempt with absolute paths
# app_path = r""C:\Users\oayod\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\Test\navbar\app.py""
# test1_path = r""C:\Users\oayod\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\Test\navbar\pages\test1.py""
# test2_path = r""C:\Users\oayod\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\Test\navbar\pages\test2.py""

# if nav == ""Home"":
#     st.switch_page(app_path)  # from root
# if nav == ""Test 1"":
#     st.switch_page(test1_path)
# elif nav == ""Test 2"":
#     st.switch_page(test2_path)

# Attempt with relative paths
if nav == ""Home"":
    st.switch_page(""app.py"")  # from root
if nav == ""Test 1"":
    st.switch_page(""page/test1.py"")
elif nav == ""Test 2"":
    st.switch_page(""pages/test2.py"")


st.write(""This is the main page of the app."")
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Windows 11 Machine
2.  Using Versions of - streamlit: 1.45.0 streamlit-community-navigation-bar: 4.7.7
3. Directory structure is 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76de68aa-c374-4dd2-aa58-ef0ffaaaadef)
5. Run self contained example above via streamlit run app.py

### Expected Behavior

Expect page switch similar to sidebar functionality....

### Current Behavior

Error message:
Attempt with relative paths: 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb4f9fc0-6485-4050-80f3-b7eb161b8f41)
Attempt with absolute paths is similar to above.

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- Streamlit version: 1.45
- Python version: 3.11
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Browser: Microsoft Edge


### Additional Information

I have tried moving to a non shared folder i.e., using a local folder instead of onedrive location, no chage.
I also only tried using page_link due to one of the suggestions in issue #8103

I understand that this has been an issue since this time last year (browsed several threads dated feb 2024), and just wanted to confirm if there are any fixes i may have missed or any workarounds/hacks not suggested before.

streamlit/streamlit,3035705196,11252,date_input fails with StreamlitAPIException when typing a date outside the selectable range,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

`date_input` fails with `StreamlitAPIException` when typing a date that is out of bounds according `min_value` or `max_value`. A user may trip this by mistake while editing a date using the keyboard. It does not require the user to click out of the field.

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
import streamlit as st
from datetime import date

# Set the default date
if ""some_date"" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.some_date = date(2023, 1, 1)

# Display the date input widget
st.date_input(
    ""some_date"",
    min_value=date(2023, 1, 1),
    key=""some_date"",
)
```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Click to type in the date input field
2. Change the year to 2022 (without even leaving the field)
3. The application raises `StreamlitAPIException`

### Expected Behavior

I would expect no error. I don't know what the exact behavior should be. When entering an invalid date like `2022/22/22` it is never sent to the streamlit backend, even though field keeps showing `2022/22/22`. In previous versions I believe it it would revert to the last valid date. If you don't use session_state for the default, the out-of-bound date is returned in the backend. That seems problematic as well.

I would prefer the frontend to prevent dates that are outside the range. That could be by reverting to the last valid date. For consistency that should apply both when setting the default through `session_state` or `value`.

### Current Behavior

Error message:
```
 streamlit.errors.StreamlitAPIException: The default value of [datetime.date(2022, 1, 1)] must lie between the min_value of 2023-01-01 and the 
 max_value of 2032-01-01, inclusively.
 ```

streamlit/streamlit,3032848291,11248,[WIP] Fully support `weight` and `unicode-range` in `@font-face` declaration,"## Describe your changes
Currently, when declaring a font in `[[theme.fontFaces]]` in `config.toml`, the `weight` field is interpreted as an integer and `unicode-range` is not supported at all.

This PR supports declaring weight by keyword (""normal"", ""bold"") as well as declaring weight ranges for variable font files (""100 900""). Additionally, this adds support for unicode range. This may be beneficial if a font is broken out into different files (e.g. basic and extended latin characters) and can be helpful for localization. Even if an app developer doesn't explicitly localize their app, they can define character sets for other languages that will only conditionally load if someone uses a browser extension to translate the page, for example.

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.
- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.

### Summary

Currently, `config.toml` does not support the `unicode-range` CSS `@font-face descriptor. For localization, this descriptor is helpful.

### Why?

Even if an app developer doesn't explicitly localize their app, many browser extension may provide in-place translations. With this description, additional character sets can be included that will only conditionally load if one of their characters is used. Thus, you can define a font for your app, and provide additional font file declarations if you expect people to translate your app into a language requiring another character set.

e.g. Choose a pretty font and write an app in English which will load the latin character sets. Include Chinese, Japanese, and Korean font sets that match your pretty font so that in-place translations stay pretty, without unnecessarily loading them for everyone.

<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases"">playwright's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v1.52.0</h2>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New method <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-contain-class"">expect(locator).to_contain_class()</a> to ergonomically assert individual class names on the element.</p>
<pre lang=""python""><code>  expect(page.get_by_role(&quot;listitem&quot;, name=&quot;Ship v1.52&quot;)).to_contain_class(&quot;done&quot;)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/aria-snapshots"">Aria Snapshots</a> got two new properties: <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/aria-snapshots#strict-matching""><code>/children</code></a> for strict matching and <code>/url</code> for links.</p>
<pre lang=""python""><code>expect(locator).to_match_aria_snapshot(&quot;&quot;&quot;
  - list
    - /children: equal
    - listitem: Feature A
    - listitem:
      - link &quot;Feature B&quot;:
        - /url: &quot;https://playwright.dev&quot;
&quot;&quot;&quot;)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>New option <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-apirequest#api-request-new-context-option-max-redirects""><code>max_redirects</code></a> in <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-apirequest#api-request-new-context"">apiRequest.new_context()</a> to control the maximum number of redirects.</li>
<li>New option <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-aria-snapshot-option-ref""><code>ref</code></a> in <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-aria-snapshot"">locator.aria_snapshot()</a> to generate reference for each element in the snapshot which can later be used to locate the element.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Method <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-route#route-continue"">route.continue()</a> does not allow to override the <code>Cookie</code> header anymore. If a <code>Cookie</code> header is provided, it will be ignored, and the cookie will be loaded from the browser's cookie store. To set custom cookies, use <a href=""https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-add-cookies"">browserContext.add_cookies()</a>.</li>
<li>macOS 13 is now deprecated and will no longer receive WebKit updates. Please upgrade to a more recent macOS version to continue benefiting from the latest WebKit improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Browser Versions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chromium 136.0.7103.25</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox 137.0</li>
<li>WebKit 18.4</li>
</ul>
<p>This version was also tested against the following stable channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Chrome 135</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge 135</li>
</ul>

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.
- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.

### Summary

Related issue: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11021

Hi! A lot of companies do not permit the use of ChatGPT, due potential data leaks, GDPR, or even Commercial or Intellectual Property conflicts. Streamlit is widely used, and constantly used for internal end users to test something. 

### Why?

So, if I create a simple ST app for our Data Science team (who will run the app locally / localhost for testing), and something fails (i.e. error shows queries, tables, PII, etc.), the end users will not hesitate in clicking the ChatGPT button. We can't share any info with ChatGPT. We have our corporate Virtual Assistant equivalent for these type of tasks. 

### How?

A simple way to disable this feature, even if it runs only on localhost.

streamlit/streamlit,3029847171,11232,Multiple classes found for path error when reload with model relationships,"### Checklist

- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.
- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.

### Summary

## Issue Description

When using Streamlit with SQLModel, errors occur when reloading the application after making code changes to model files. The errors are related to model registration and mapper initialization.

## Environment

- Python: 3.13
- Streamlit: 1.44.1
- SQLModel: 0.0.24
- OS: macOS

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a minimal project with the following structure:

  - app/
    - models/
      - models.py # Contains all model definitions
    - database.py # Database connection setup 
    - main.py # Streamlit application


2. Define models with relationships:
```python
# models.py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Relationship

class Restaurant(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    menus: List[""Menu""] = Relationship(back_populates=""restaurant"")

class Menu(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    restaurant_id: int = Field(foreign_key=""restaurant.id"")
    restaurant: Restaurant = Relationship(back_populates=""menus"")
    orders: List[""Order""] = Relationship(back_populates=""menu_items"", link_model=""OrderMenuItem"")

class Order(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    menu_items: List[""Menu""] = Relationship(back_populates=""orders"", link_model=""OrderMenuItem"")
```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app/main.py

4. Make any code change to models.py (e.g., add a comment or modify a field description)

Note: Simply reloading the page without code changes does NOT trigger the error
The error occurs when reloading after making code modifications

5. Make another code change and reload again

## Expected Behavior
The application should properly handle reloading and maintain the relationships between models when code changes are made and the page is reloaded.

## Actual Behavior
### After First Code Change and Reload
```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Multiple classes found for path ""[ClassName]"" in the registry of this declarative base. Please use a fully module-qualified path.
```

### After Second Code Change and Reload
```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: One or more mappers failed to initialize - can't proceed with initialization of other mappers. Triggering mapper: 'Mapper[Restaurant(restaurant)]'. Original exception was: Multiple classes found for path ""Menu"" in the registry of this declarative base. Please use a fully module-qualified path.
```

#### Key observations:

1. Errors only occur when reloading after code changes
2. Simple page refreshes without code changes work normally
3. First reload after code change produces a simpler error about multiple classes
4. Second reload after code change produces a error involving mapper initialization
5. Both errors indicate issues with multiple class registrations

### Reproducible Code Example

```Python
## models.py


from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Relationship

class Restaurant(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = ""restaurant""
    __table_args__ = {""extend_existing"": True}

    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str = Field(max_length=100, nullable=False)
    address: str = Field(max_length=200, nullable=False)
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    menus: List[""Menu""] = Relationship(back_populates=""restaurant"")

class OrderMenuItem(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = ""order_menu_item""
    __table_args__ = {""extend_existing"": True}

    order_id: int = Field(foreign_key=""order.id"", primary_key=True)
    menu_id: int = Field(foreign_key=""menu.id"", primary_key=True)
    quantity: int = Field(default=1, nullable=False)
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)

class Menu(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = ""menu""
    __table_args__ = {""extend_existing"": True}

    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    restaurant_id: int = Field(foreign_key=""restaurant.id"", nullable=False)
    name: str = Field(max_length=100, nullable=False)
    price: int = Field(nullable=False)
    description: Optional[str] = Field(max_length=500, nullable=True, description=""menu's description"")
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    restaurant: Restaurant = Relationship(back_populates=""menus"")
    orders: List[""Order""] = Relationship(back_populates=""menu_items"", link_model=OrderMenuItem)

class Order(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = ""order""
    __table_args__ = {""extend_existing"": True}

    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    table_number: int = Field(nullable=False)
    status: str = Field(max_length=20, nullable=False, default=""pending"", description=""order status"")
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    menu_items: List[""Menu""] = Relationship(back_populates=""orders"", link_model=OrderMenuItem)

```

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run application
2. Make changes to the code somewhere
3. Reload browser

### Expected Behavior

The application should properly handle reloading and maintain the relationships between models when code changes are made and the page is reloaded.

### Current Behavior

Error message:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Multiple classes found for path ""Menu"" in the registry of this declarative base. Please use a fully module-qualified path.
```

### Is this a regression?

- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.

### Debug info

- Python: 3.13.2
- Streamlit: 1.44.1
- SQLModel: 0.0.24
- OS: macOS
- Browser: Chrome

### Additional Information

It seems that the same error is occurring in the following post. 
But since there was no answer, I created this issue again here.

streamlit/streamlit,3029679293,11231,Make Carto the default map provider (like in PyDeck),"## Describe your changes

**Background:**

st.pydeck_chart and st.map currently use Mapbox as their default map provider. However, Mapbox requires users to pass an API key first. In the past, we provided a default API key for users, but the whole thing always had a funny smell.

Somewhat recently, Pydeck changed their default map provider from Mapbox to Carto -- which _does not_ require an API key. But this didn't apply to Streamlit users because we had overridden the default with Mapbox.

This PR addresses this.

**What this PR does:**
1. Makes Streamlit follow Pydeck's behavior by using Carto by default.
2. No longer fetches our Mapbox API key from the cloud.
3. Deprecates the `mapbox.token` config option. We now refer users to Pydeck's `api_keys` arg or `MAPBOX_API_KEY` env var. The old config option is still supported, though.
4. Totally unrelated, but this also cleans up the docs for some config options, so they print better with `streamlit config show`.

NOTE: For this to work in locked-down hosts (like Snowflake) they'll have to add this to their CSP allow list:
```
connect-src: https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/ https://*.basemaps.cartocdn.com/
```

Or, if you want to be really picky...
```
connect-src: https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/ https://tiles.basemaps.cartocdn.com/ https://tiles-b.basemaps.cartocdn.com/  https://tiles-c.basemaps.cartocdn.com/  https://tiles-d.basemaps.cartocdn.com/
```
...but I worry Carto may add mote tile servers in the future and this will be a forever game.
