streamlit/streamlit,311577371,28,ForwardMsg de-duping,"This is the first part of ForwardMsg caching:

## Server

- `ForwardMsg.hash` is calculated on every outgoing ForwardMsg
- The server caches all messages whose size is >= 10k in its `MessageCache` instance. (These cached message are never evicted - this will come in a future PR.) Each entry in the cache contains the cached message, and also a (weak-referenced) set of all ReportSessions for which that message has already been delivered.
- Cached ForwardMsgs have the `metadata.cacheable` flag set. When the client receives a ForwardMsg with `cacheable == true`, it also caches it.
- If the server believes that a client has cached a given ForwardMsg (because the cache has an entry for that message+session), it instead sends a ""reference"" message that points to the original message via `ForwardMsg.ref_hash`.
- The server also exposes a new HTTP endpoint, `/message`, from which clients can request messages that they have received a `ref_hash` message for, but are missing in that client's local cache. (This should not happen frequently! If clients are getting a bunch of local cache misses, then the server is not maintaining its cache properly.)

## Client

- `WebsocketConnection` has a new `ForwardMsgCache` member
- All incoming `ForwardMsgs` are passed through this cache (via `ForwardMsgCache.processMessage`):
  - If the ForwardMsg is *not* a reference message, it is cached locally and nothing more is done
  - If the ForwardMsg *is* a reference message, the client checks to see if it has the original message in its cache; if so, it gets returned
  - If the reference message is missing from the client's cache, it is requested from the server's `/message` endpoint, and then cached.

## TODO:

- The client and server both need to perform cache eviction; currently, their caches never have anything removed from them.
- I'd like to have some better client tests that use a mock server to test its handling of the `/message` endpoint",tconkling,709022,closed,False,2019-08-27T21:34:04+00:00,2019-08-28T20:35:59+00:00,2019-08-28T20:35:49+00:00,2019-08-28T20:35:49+00:00,10061f7da841336081a5d0519249276320386d6a,dirty,819,76,17,58,34,0,,,

streamlit/streamlit,316130291,82,ForwardMsgCache expiration,"This implements `ForwardMsgCache` expiration on both the client and the server.

- The `global.maxCachedMessageAge` config value specifies the maximum age of a message in the cache. The age of a message is defined by the number of times a referencing report has finished running since the message was accessed by that report. So when a report finishes running for the first time, the age of all its cached messages is 1.
- Our default maxCachedMessageAge is 2, which means that messages will remain cached even after not having been referenced for a report run.
- To determine the age of messages in its cache, the server tracks a `report_run_count` alongside each `ReportSession` in its websocket->reportsession dictionary. The server increments this value each time it processes a `report_finished` ForwardMsg message for a report.
- When the server increments `report_finished`, it also asks the cache to remove any expired messages. I haven't done anything fancy here - the cache just iterates through all its entries, does an age check, and deletes them if they're expired. @tvst, I know you were potentially concerned about performance issues with the ""iterate the whole cache"" strategy. We could add a simple timer to this function to collect local metrics to see if it's actually an issue?
- Similarly, when the client receives a `report_finished` ForwardMsg, it performs the same cache expiration step. This means that the server and client's caches should stay in sync. (I haven't thought hard enough about whether it's possible for them to get briefly out of sync, but if they do, we have the new `/message` endpoint as a fallback.)
- If a report fails to run due to a compilation error, neither the server nor the client will increment the `report_run_count` for that session. (The run-count incrementing is conditional on the status value of the `report_finished` message, which is set to `FINISHED_WITH_COMPILE_ERROR` when that happens.)


There are client and server tests for all this new logic. But the easiest way to see the expiration in action is to run something like `examples/core/message_deduping.py` and watch the debug output on the server and the client. (You'll see logs for cache hits and misses - you should never see a miss! - on the client; and logs for sending cached message refs on the server.)
- This example just creates a big dataframe and sends it twice
- The first time the report is run, the message will only be delivered to the client once.
- If you rerun the report, the message won't be delivered at all because it'll be cached.
- If you remove the `st.dataframe()` calls and rerun the report, the dataframe will *not* be removed from the cache because it won't be old enough. Re-adding those calls and rerunning the report should confirm this.
- If you remove the dataframe calls and re-run the report _twice_ with them missing, they will then be expired from the cache. Re-adding them should result in the message being resent to the client.",tconkling,709022,closed,False,2019-09-10T18:53:29+00:00,2019-09-17T18:10:40+00:00,2019-09-17T18:10:36+00:00,2019-09-17T18:10:36+00:00,bbbb2869743e4fa46cc3d2ffa39432cd6b8d2c71,dirty,1018,418,24,20,12,0,monchier,,

streamlit/streamlit,316282840,88,Better method signatures,"Most DeltaGenerator methods are decorated with helper functions that insert special arguments into them. For example, the arugment `element` is inserted into almost every DeltaGenerator method, and `ui_value` is inserted into every widget method.

These arguments aren't be user-visible, in the sense that users can't pass their own `element` proto into these methods. So a while back we implemented the `_wraps_with_cleaned_sig` function to modify some special metadata in those methods, so the `element` argument wouldn't appear in the output of utilities like Python's `help()` function, ipython's `?`, Streamlit's `st.help`, and our autogenerated API docs.

But we never updated the `_wraps_with_cleaned_sig` decorator to appropriately the user-hidden `ui_value` argument from widget methods. So that's what I'm doing in this PR.

In this PR, the actual fix was the introduction of the `num_args_to_remove` argument to the `_wraps_with_cleaned_sig` function. Everything else is just some cleanup and minor refactor, which should have no effect on actual logic.",tvst,690814,closed,False,2019-09-11T05:51:14+00:00,2019-09-19T00:21:35+00:00,2019-09-19T00:21:31+00:00,2019-09-19T00:21:31+00:00,b6734272dbc22cad24520be190d0554921d46e2a,unknown,35,63,2,47,3,0,kantuni,,

I used `requests` (instead of urllib) for this, which entailed adding it as an explicit dependency in our Pipfile. All the other places in streamlit that used urllib for fetching over HTTP have been replaced with requests. (And there are some additional tests that didn't previously exist.)

streamlit/streamlit,318906966,133,"Test running streamlit commands ""bare""","- Adds a new test step to CircleCI: ""Run Integration Tests"", and an associated Make rule `make integration-tests`
- This runs `scripts/run_bare_integration_tests.py`, which runs all the e2e tests in ""bare"" mode - that is, via `python script.py` instead of `streamlit run script.py`. The test script ensures that all the e2e scripts exit with a zero exit code.
- Streamlit detects if it's running in bare mode via a new global, `_is_running_with_streamlit`. This defaults to false, and gets set to true by the `streamlit run` CLI command.
- When running in bare mode, streamlit does not show ""missing ReportContext"" warnings.
- This PR also pins the streamlit numpy dependency to < 1.17 when installed in a Python 2 environment; numpy 1.17 dropped support for Py2.

streamlit/streamlit,320524434,178,Merge ForwardMsg caching into develop ,"Implements ForwardMsg caching on the client and server.

## Server

- `ForwardMsg.hash` is calculated on every outgoing ForwardMsg
- The server caches all messages whose size is >= 10k in its `MessageCache` instance. (These cached message are never evicted - this will come in a future PR.) Each entry in the cache contains the cached message, and also a (weak-referenced) set of all ReportSessions for which that message has already been delivered.
- Cached ForwardMsgs have the `metadata.cacheable` flag set. When the client receives a ForwardMsg with `cacheable == true`, it also caches it.
- If the server believes that a client has cached a given ForwardMsg (because the cache has an entry for that message+session), it instead sends a ""reference"" message that points to the original message via `ForwardMsg.ref_hash`.
- The server also exposes a new HTTP endpoint, `/message`, from which clients can request messages that they have received a `ref_hash` message for, but are missing in that client's local cache. (This should not happen frequently! If clients are getting a bunch of local cache misses, then the server is not maintaining its cache properly.)

## Client

- `WebsocketConnection` has a new `ForwardMsgCache` member
- All incoming `ForwardMsgs` are passed through this cache (via `ForwardMsgCache.processMessage`):
  - If the ForwardMsg is *not* a reference message, it is cached locally and nothing more is done
  - If the ForwardMsg *is* a reference message, the client checks to see if it has the original message in its cache; if so, it gets returned
  - If the reference message is missing from the client's cache, it is requested from the server's `/message` endpoint, and then cached.

## Cache expiration

- The `global.maxCachedMessageAge` config value specifies the maximum age of a message in the cache. The age of a message is defined by the number of times a referencing report has finished running since the message was accessed by that report. So when a report finishes running for the first time, the age of all its cached messages is 1.
- Our default maxCachedMessageAge is 2, which means that messages will remain cached even after not having been referenced for a report run.
- To determine the age of messages in its cache, the server tracks a `report_run_count` alongside each `ReportSession` in its websocket->reportsession dictionary. The server increments this value each time it processes a `report_finished` ForwardMsg message for a report.
- When the server increments `report_finished`, it also asks the cache to remove any expired messages. I haven't done anything fancy here - the cache just iterates through all its entries, does an age check, and deletes them if they're expired.
- Similarly, when the client receives a `report_finished` ForwardMsg, it performs the same cache expiration step. This means that the server and client's caches should stay in sync. (I haven't thought hard enough about whether it's possible for them to get briefly out of sync, but if they do, we have the new `/message` endpoint as a fallback.)
- If a report fails to run due to a compilation error, neither the server nor the client will increment the `report_run_count` for that session. (The run-count incrementing is conditional on the status value of the `report_finished` message, which is set to `FINISHED_WITH_COMPILE_ERROR` when that happens.)


There are client and server tests for all this new logic. But the easiest way to see the expiration in action is to run something like `examples/core/message_deduping.py` and watch the debug output on the server and the client. (You'll see logs for cache hits and misses - you should never see a miss! - on the client; and logs for sending cached message refs on the server.)
- This example just creates a big dataframe and sends it twice
- The first time the report is run, the message will only be delivered to the client once.
- If you rerun the report, the message won't be delivered at all because it'll be cached.
- If you remove the `st.dataframe()` calls and rerun the report, the dataframe will *not* be removed from the cache because it won't be old enough. Re-adding those calls and rerunning the report should confirm this.
- If you remove the dataframe calls and re-run the report _twice_ with them missing, they will then be expired from the cache. Re-adding them should result in the message being resent to the client.",tconkling,709022,closed,False,2019-09-23T23:46:04+00:00,2019-09-24T19:34:05+00:00,2019-09-24T19:27:06+00:00,2019-09-24T19:27:06+00:00,fbe5c3840d4777005a67a41dad6d5c60072b5653,unknown,1561,142,25,14,0,1,,,

👆I don't consider it looks great, I'd prefer it to have a break line after every option, but wasn't able to find a way to format the description for an option in click.

## Things that keep this away from being perfect:
 - we can add a nice error when type casting fails (like when sending `--server.port ""asd""`)
 - better format to `streamlit run --help`

 - something that seems unusual to me is that calling `config._set_option` only works when the option is not existing in the config file! 🤔
