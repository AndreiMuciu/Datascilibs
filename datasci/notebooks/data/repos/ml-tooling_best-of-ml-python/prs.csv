Cornac is a comparative framework for multimodal recommender systems. It focuses on making it convenient to work with models leveraging auxiliary data (e.g., item descriptive text and image, social network, etc). Cornac enables fast experiments and straightforward implementations of new models. It is highly compatible with existing machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

Add openpyxl as suggested in #30. For now, I have not removed xlrd as it still is a popular project with 1.8k stars and the last commit activity in December 2020; hence, I would suggest to keep it in the list for now. Maybe a *deprecated* attribute or so for projects could make sense.
