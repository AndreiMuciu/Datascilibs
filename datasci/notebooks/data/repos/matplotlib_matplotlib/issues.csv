matplotlib/matplotlib,3054783929,30037,Update top message matplotlibrc file,"
## PR summary

As suggested in #29699 , I updated the top message of the `matplotlibrc` file.

From: `## NOTE FOR END USERS: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!`

To: `## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, MAKE A COPY FIRST`

For me, this makes it more obvious that this file **can** be modified, as long as it is a copy of the original. The current message suggests that users should never touch this file. Even if the text just after says you can make a copy, I think a lot of people will stop reading because of the uppercase message at the top.

See the discussion [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/29699).

matplotlib/matplotlib,3054272365,30036,Remove cutout for missing font file in PdfFile._embedTeXFont.,"If fontfile is None, an error would already have been raised earlier in dviFontName (which explicitly checks for this case).

(The cutout in _embedTeXFont was introduced first, in ed0066f (2009), but support for that case appears to have been broken a bit later and the check in dviFontName was then introduced in 4fcc0e7 (2016) where it simply improved the clarity of the exception ultimately raised. -- attn @jkseppan, who wrote both commits?)

Noted in relation to #29807.
