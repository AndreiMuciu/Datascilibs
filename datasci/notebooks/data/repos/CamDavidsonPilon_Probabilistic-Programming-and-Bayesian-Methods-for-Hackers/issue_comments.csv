Now I think 0.05 and 0.35 might have their roots in the plot. Something like majority of mass falling in the range of [0.05, 0.35].  After reading chapter 3, I try az.plot_posterior with hdi_prob=0.8, then I get a plot saying 80% hdi lies between 0.042 and 0.35. 

Don't know whether the above guess is correct or not. But I decide to read on later chapters in the hope of things will get clear thereafter.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0
