There are more substantial changes that would want to make but don't want to mess up the voice of the document.

Namely:

1) Highlight MCMC is just a means of performing  Bayesian Inference. There are other algorithms for doing it that are beyond the scope of the book.

2) MCMC roughly moves towards regions of high probability, but the goal is not to find the Maximum A-Posterior point. MH moves are designed so as to make sure our samples are still from the target distribution.

3) The mixture models example will have an exponential number of peaks, but because they are all isomorphic to each other, sampling around any of them is not a big deal.

I am including this here more to clarify how much detail do you believe is appropriate for this book.

I revamped the tricky ""density scatter plot"", so it's easier to grasp and 
much faster to compute. not as pretty though IMO.

There's a trick you might not be aware of, if you append a semicolon
to the last line in a cell, the output will be supressed, but any plots will
be displayed, so you can get rid of the ""noise"" arising from the output of the last
command (usually a label or similar).

I had trouble with the density plot when using ipnb with a sympy profile,
not sure what that was all about.

in the section ""Including observations in the Model"" , you elided (somewhat) the difference 
between assigning a value vs. an array of values to a stochastic variable,
I would have appreciated a bit more contex at that point, although it becomes
clearer later.

Thanks again for all your work and making it freely available,
chapter3 will be along presently.

CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers,4779383,27,CH3: various tweaks,"Hi cam, 

Just read through ch3, here are my notes.
as always, please accept what you like and disregard the rest.

Some notes as a reader:
- re the introduction discussing ""space"" and ""surface"", IIUC, an important
  role of the prior is to assign **zero** probability to some areas and thereby
  forbid the MCMC from entering that region. That also explains the concept
  of a ""surface"" in the space, in that the limited extent of the ""surface"" corresponds
  to the finite area of p(x)>0 in the example.
  I suggest that the ""0 probablity there"" role of the prior be  touched upon in the intro.
- quote ""This is not as trivial as it may appear."" - actually does not appear trivial at all.
- there's a comment in a code cell ""# notice the size"", which directs my attention
  but does not explain what exactly is the point of that param.
-  in the ""Algorithms to perform MCMC"" section
  1. step 3 is really the algorithmic counterpoint to the observation data  ""stretching and shaping"" analogy you gave in the intro, it would be good to make that connection at that point.
  2. the pseudo code doesn't describe the ""else"" clause, what happens when we
     reject a step.
  3. quote: 

```
In the pseudo-code algorithm of MCMC above, the only position that matters 
is the current position. Thus it is fine to halt an MCMC algorithm and inspect 
its progress, with the intention of starting it up again later
```

It's unclear if this a property shared by all MCMC algorithms, an implementation
detail of pyMC's chosen algorithm. is the random walk process always memoryless?
- will definitly try my hand atn interactive webGL visualization of the ""mountain
  as function of sample size"" visualization. what a wonderful example.
- couldn't reproduce the 2x2 cluster plots, I just get blank plots
  maybe the ylim is off?
- can't reproduce the first mixture model grap, I get a blank screen
- I reworded the paragraph about choosing a best point estimate of the gaussian
  parameters, since it stated it couldn't be done and then proceeded to do so. :)
- fixed a code error in the ""Important: Values in a sample "" section, misnamed
  variable
- I'm note sure I understood this section. is the point you were making that since
  various rvs are related, you can't mix and match samples from different indices?
  that's what was intended by the ""indexing correctly"" remark? you state that exactly
  after the example, but I found this a bit hard to read.
-  in the ""Diagnosing Convergence"" section, quote
  `Earlier I mentioned that the autocorrelation`, I believe that's actually
  the first time autocorrelation is mentioned in the document, perhaps
  previously edited out?
- there seems to be a spurious markdown cell right below the ""thinning"" section
- `pymc.Matplot.plot()` section, the second cell suggests there ought to be a
  figure there, demonstrating the use of  `pymc.Matplot.plot()`, it seems to be missing.

That's it, a bit long I know.

Gorgeous, gorgeous graphs!

I've fixed the most obvious one (use of straight ASCII quotes instead of the correct markdown supported curly once [’, “, ”]) and the most awkward one (use of pipe instead of midline when denoting conditional probability; that is `p(a|b)` as opposed to `p(a | b)`).

There are a few more,
- The use of html-escapes instead of markdown-supported unicodes (`&mdash;` instead of simply instering a ""—"").
- None hyperlinked footnotes and citations.
- Manually inserted line-height parameters (`\\[5pt]`) doesn't render correctly in markdown (although that is more of a _bug_ than wrong typesetting).
- Use of `\sim` to denote negation, `~\sim` will leave whitespace intact (though personally I think ¬A `\neg A` is more beautiful than ~A)

I'm sure there are more, and I will probably be working my self on this PR.

I made some copy edits in Chapter 1 for flow, language, and continuity. If you find these useful, I can do more in later chapters as well.

Nothing substantive has been changed except that I added short blurbs about the physical interpretations of the Poisson and exponential distributions. I understand that they're used mostly as a basis for a discussion of their form, but knowing what they represent may help spark readers' intuition.
