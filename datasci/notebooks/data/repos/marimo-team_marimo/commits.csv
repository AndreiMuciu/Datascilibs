Closes #4564 

This change adds a `should_exit` property to `mo.Thread` which evaluates
to `True`
when the thread's spawning cell lifecycle has ended. This makes it
possible for developers to clean up their threads.

This change also adds a utility method, mo.current_thread(), that
returns the current thread of control if it is a marimo.Thread object,
and raises otherwise. Developers could technically use
threading.current_thread() instead, but this method provides
type safety and validation.

Popover that displays single row data vertically. By default, it will
show all rows in current page. If there is selection, it will show those
rows instead.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2898dc0b-d78b-4b74-a551-945c019c3e2c)

Some limitations:
- The data is limited to whatever page the table is on. Does not persist
selections across pages.
- When you navigate through the page and select/deselect, the index on
the page stays the same, meaning you could view different data as you
select more rows. We don't keep track of the selected row id as the page
number.

Todo:
- [ ] add tanstack table feature (focus row)
- [ ] tests

This makes it so that the description for `on_change` in the
method-level API matches the class-level API.

## üìù Summary
As mentioned in #4827 :
> The [**class-level** API reference for `marimo.ui.form`
](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/form/#marimo.ui.form)correctly
distinguishes the two parameters:
> 
> * **validate** (`Callable[[Optional[JSONType]], Optional[str]]`): A
function that takes the form's value and returns an error message if the
value is invalid, or None if the value is valid. Defaults to None.
> * **on_change** (`Callable[[Optional[T]], None]`): Optional callback
to run when this element's value changes. Defaults to None.
> 
> However, the [**method-level**
docs](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/form/#marimo.ui.form.form)
wrongly describe **both** parameters as returning an error message,
implying they‚Äôre interchangeable.

## üîç Description of Changes
This Fixes #4827 by making sure the:
>**method-level** documentation matches the **class-level** docs for
`on_change`.

- Run lint on examples/, scripts/, and docs/ code
- For code within Marimo notebooks themselves, enable [UTF-8
Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#utf8-mode) by default,
e.g. when the user runs `marimo run`, or in WASM environment.

This adds support for inline-script metadata for pyodide.

If there are dependencies declared inline, then we use those. Otherwise
we fallback to the pyodide parsing of imports (which was what we did
previously).

This also parses inline script metadata for config.

This looks like more lines of code, but mostly:
1. lots of tests written and backfilled
2. some utils moved around",1365,531,1896,25,69da3b41acb703266f1fcc642f4f4ebaf5e64256
