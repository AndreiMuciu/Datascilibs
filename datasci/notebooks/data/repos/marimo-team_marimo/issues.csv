marimo-team/marimo,3057128725,4880,Problem with multiselect of mo.ui.file_browser.value and DataFrames with Path objects,"### Describe the bug

Create a `mo.ui.file_browser` to select some files (`multiple=True`). 

My objective is to retrieve all selected filepaths (absolute full path) into a DataFrame column. `file_browser.path(index)` seems for single file only. I couldn't find yet an officially straightforward way to acquire in batch.

My current method to make do is plain old looping, like `polar.Series([str(file.path) for file in file_browser.value])` or similar.

Mind the explicit `str()` because Marimo and/or Polars aren't happy with directly handling cells with path objects. Without explicit `str()` they'll err and complain ""csv writer does not support object dtype"" if I call `write_csv()`.

So please enlighten me if there are better ways to do this.

- [x] Missing
- [ ] Outdated
- [ ] Confusing
- [ ] Not sure?

### Explain in Detail

This isn't exactly about marimo documentation, but rather about marimo potentially taking advantage of auto-documenting available in FastAPI.  Feel free to convert to feature request if appropriate.

It would be great to auto-document marimo apps that take query parameters the way that FastAPI does that, using [pydantic query models](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-param-models/) and [OpenAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata).




### Your Suggestion for Changes

As marimo are Starlette, not FastAPI apps, they don't take the `docs_url` parameters that build the OpenAPI schemas and the `/docs` endpoints.   [This ](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/extending-openapi/#modify-the-openapi-schema) also doesn't work:

```
from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi

openapi_schema = get_openapi(
    title=""Custom title"",
    version=""2.5.0"",
    summary=""This is a very custom OpenAPI schema"",
    description=""Here's a longer description of the custom **OpenAPI** schema"",
    routes=app.routes,  # mounted Marimo routes do not show up here
)
```

If it is possible to build OpenAPI docs, would you please suggest how?
I can then add PR on docs about docs :)

### Suggested solution

I would like to be able to write code like
```
import buckaroo # micropip.install
```
and have it installed with micropip in the pyodide environment.  Obviously the comment would do nothing in regular python because it's a comment.

marimo-team/marimo,3056585986,4875,Optionnaly make Slider/RangeSlider text-boxed,"### Description

I'd like to have in marimo a ""TextSlider"", that is a slider where the displayed value is actually a text area : the text is updated if the slider is moved to represent the appropriate value, but the text can also be edited and when validated, the slider's position updates accordingly.
This is because sometimes I like just moving the slider left and right to see of my system evolves, but sometimes I know exactly the value I want to try - and writing that value is way faster and intuitive than fine-tunning the slider's position.

One approach to do so is to create a bidrectionnaly link between a Slider and a Number, but it requires using the `state` approach which seems un-recommended, and not very satisfying for many reasons (need to declare several widgets in separte cellc, use mo.state):

```python
# put those 4 different cells
get_y, set_y = mo.state(0)

y_slider = mo.ui.slider(
    start=vmin,
    stop=vmax,
    value=get_y(),
    on_change=set_y,
    label=""y from slider:"",
)

y_number = mo.ui.number(
    start=vmin,
    stop=vmax,
    value=get_y(),
    on_change=set_y,
    label=""y from number:"",
)

y_slider, y_number
```

Back in ipython/ipywidgets, I was able to create a `QuantityTextSlider`, which was a pure python ipywidget that provided this feature (as well as a parsing to convert the actual value into a Quantity object, not just a float). See [example](https://github.com/mocquin/physipy-widgets/blob/main/notebooks/Physipy%20widgets%20for%20ipython.ipynb) and [code](https://github.com/mocquin/physipy-widgets/blob/94e42370d9f29dea0ae04f9ae0429580cfeaafd5/physipywidgets/qipywidgets.py#L326)

Another example of use is using a slider to browse images using the image component where the index of the image displayed is given by the slider : one could either browse left-to-right the images by sliding the slider, or go directly to a specific image given its index

Also applies to RangeSlider

### Suggested solution

Some kwarg using : `mo.ui.slider(include_text_box=bool)`

marimo-team/marimo,3054706274,4868,write_csv() on a marimo.table.value also writes extra row number,"### Describe the bug

Take a DataFrame, wrap it with marimo.ui.table, interactively select rows, then call the table's .values.write_csv() to write the selected rows.

I couldn't recall since which version, the row number (seemingly an internal hidden column ""_marimo_row_id"") also gets written into the resulting CSV as an unexpected extra column.

This behaviour should at least be opt-in via a parameter. Thanks for the attention.

The notebooks have many cells and it is possible to run it on the browser (starting the server and opening a notebook works with no issues. 

The only problem seems to be on the VSCode

marimo-team/marimo,3047951555,4842,Marimo ignores ctrl-c when running with --sandbox on Windows,"### Describe the bug

I ran `marimo edit --sandbox example.py` in PowerShell on Windows. (Fresh file)

Sometimes ctrl-c works.
Sometimes it is completely ignored.
Sometimes when I cancel quit with 'n' the kernel dies.

I've looked at the previous issues relating to ctrl-c, but they are closed.
I've installed the latest versions of Marimo and uv.

The following screenshot shows the initial run, where the ctrl-c worked, then the I selected 'n', then the kernel died. Then it shows the second run where ctrl-c never worked:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baecc22d-76bc-4de9-b22a-a90db282c324)

This is the debug log from cancelling the exit (ctrl-c, then 'n'), which leads to the kernel crashing:

I can't reproduce this 100% every time, but typically after a few tries I can reproduce this by running `marimo edit --sandbox example.py`, then creating a few simple cells such as the following:

``` python
print('hi')

1/0

print('test')
```

While `ctrl-c` typically works immediately after launching marimo, after a couple of minutes, and adding test cells like the above, `ctrl-c` often stops working.

Here is a debug log from a time when ctrl-c stopped working:

So far as I can tell, these issues only occur on Windows. If it's relevant, here's a screenshot of Task Manager at the time:

Background is that I have some altair charts with tooltip set. When a mouse hover over them, some details about the graph pop up.


When in slides mode and NOT fulll screen, the tooltip pops up fine. However, when in full screen, the tooltip does not show up.

marimo-team/marimo,3045921576,4835,marimo.ui.data_editor page_size not increasing cell height,"### Description

For other marimo.ui classes such as tables, setting the page_size parameter to a bigger number increases the visual cell size of the output. However, for the new marimo.ui.data_editor, you only get a scrollable y-axis, not an increased size of the output. 

This makes marimo.ui.data_editor not very practical to use in a published report. 

From Marimo's own AI:

For marimo tables (mo.ui.table), increasing page_size directly increases the number of rows shown per page, which in turn increases the vertical height of the table in the UI. This is the expected behavior, and is configurable via the page_size parameter. However, there is a practical upper limit (e.g., 200 rows) to prevent browser crashes due to rendering too many rows at once, as discussed in user reports and developer comments. If you set page_size too high, you may encounter errors or performance issues, and the table will grow taller to accommodate more rows per page [webpage crashes with large mo.ui.table page_size](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/issues/3407).

For marimo's data editor (mo.ui.data_editor), the page_size parameter controls how many rows are shown per page when pagination is enabled, but the component's height is not simply a function of page_size. The data editor has its own layout logic and also supports a column_sizing_mode parameter to control column widths, but there is no mention in the documentation or issues that increasing page_size will increase the vertical height of the editor in the same way as mo.ui.table. Instead, the data editor may use a fixed or internally managed height, regardless of the number of rows per page, to maintain usability and editing experience [marimo.ui.data_editor API](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/data_editor/#marimo.ui.data_editor).


### Suggested solution

Update the mo.ui.data_editor component so that its vertical height dynamically increases with the page_size parameter, matching the behavior of mo.ui.table.

Optionally, provide a configuration option to toggle between a fixed height and a dynamic height based on page_size.

Ensure that usability and performance are maintained, possibly by setting a reasonable upper limit for page_size to prevent browser performance issues (as is done for tables).

### Explain in Detail

# Clarify discrepancy between class and method docs for `validate` vs `on_change`

## Description

The [**class-level** API reference for `marimo.ui.form` ](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/form/#marimo.ui.form)correctly distinguishes the two parameters:

* **validate** (`Callable[[Optional[JSONType]], Optional[str]]`): A function that takes the form's value and returns an error message if the value is invalid, or None if the value is valid. Defaults to None.
* **on_change** (`Callable[[Optional[T]], None]`): Optional callback to run when this element's value changes. Defaults to None.

However, the [**method-level** docs](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/form/#marimo.ui.form.form) wrongly describe **both** parameters as returning an error message, implying they’re interchangeable.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeb26b10-212b-44ca-8be5-a0d39fb3195a)

I have verified that the actual behaviour of `on_change` in the **method-level** `form` indeed does not check for errors or block submission.

Happy to submit a PR, if the above sounds right.

### Your Suggestion for Changes

Ensure the **method-level** documentation matches the **class-level** docs for `on_change`.

marimo-team/marimo,3043252938,4824,Unable to set sql_output in .marimo.toml or .pyproject.toml,"### Description

I've been trying to set the default SQL Output engine to use Pandas for my project by entering the following line:
`sql_output=""pandas""` 

in my user `.marimo.toml` and project `.pyproject.toml` files but to no avail.

It appears this configuration setting cannot be set globally but it is only each workbook.

When I change the config on the UI in the notebook, I notice it changes the Python code and adds a parameter on the 4th line from:

`app = marimo.App(width=""medium"")`
to
`app = marimo.App(width=""medium"", sql_output=""pandas"")`


Is it possible to set this globally across all new notebooks that are made? This would be hugely beneficial.

Thanks!

### Suggested solution

Ability to add `sql_output` as a config setting in `.marimo.toml` or `.pyproject.toml` which will be applied to every notebook that is run in the project

marimo-team/marimo,3039841733,4809,relative path in tool uv sources should be respected in `--sandbox`,"### Description

I'm hoping to do something like the folllowing:

```
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --with marimo marimo edit --sandbox

# /// script
# requires-python = "">=3.12""
# dependencies = [
#     ""my_custom_package==0.1.0"",
#     ""marimo"",
#     ""rich"",
# ]
#
# [tool.uv.sources]
# my_custom_package = { path = ""../"" }
# ///
```

I'm using a relative path one level up because this file is located in `./notebooks/marimo-notebook-name.py` and the root of the repository has `my_custom_package`.

If I use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` in the shebang the relative path works correctly but with `marimo edit --sandbox` it doesn't.

### Suggested solution

`marimo edit --sandbox` should work exactly like `uv`'s script tag.

Just think this would be nice and quick way to play with files locally.

### Suggested solution

I don't think we have to make this specific to marimo.app
I think we can:

 - Set and document a user agent, with the expectation said user agent should be given a valid notebooks
 - or document that we'll look for <url>.py

and make the relevant changes to marimo cloud

Currently, progress_bar throws an error when used with iterators without setting the total. There are cases when total is unknown but it's convenient still show the progress as the number of completed iterations, without the fraction of total.

### Suggested solution

Don't show the progress bar when used with an iterator without setting the total. Just show the progress as the number of completed iterations. This is actually a tqdm-like behaviour.

Spinner is not a solution because it doesn't show the number of completed iterations.

Dear Marimo Team, I’m a professor and researcher who loves Marimo and is transitioning from Jupyter. Your work is fantastic! I often use slides for presentations and was wondering if you plan to support subslides or fragment cell types, similar to Jupyter, to enhance Marimo’s presentation features.

Thank you and keep up the great work!

Best,

- When you navigate through the page and select/deselect, the index on the page stays the same, meaning you could view different data as you select more rows. We don't keep track of the selected row id as the page number.

marimo-team/marimo,3036186306,4786,"improvement: support more parameter descriptions, e.g. in `polars`","## 📝 Summary

Small follow up to #4673.

## 🔍 Description of Changes

Polars often uses a simplified rst format for parameters where it does not include types.

This requires `docstring-to-markdown` v0.17 with:
- https://github.com/python-lsp/docstring-to-markdown/pull/44

For example, before there was only one parameter with description for `polars.io.parquet.functions.read_parquet`, and now all 22 are displayed.

Parameters from functions with overloads such as `polars.io.database.functions.read_database` remain without good suggestions.

marimo-team/marimo,3035698305,4782,feat: mo.thread lifecycle,"Closes #4564 

This change adds a `should_exit` property to `mo.Thread` which evaluates to `True`
when the thread's spawning cell lifecycle has ended. This makes it
possible for developers to clean up their threads.

This change also adds a utility method, mo.current_thread(), that
returns the current thread of control if it is a marimo.Thread object,
and raises otherwise. Developers could technically use
threading.current_thread() instead, but this method provides
type safety and validation.",akshayka,1994308,closed,False,2,2025-05-02T10:33:14+00:00,2025-05-09T23:25:04+00:00,2025-05-09T23:21:53+00:00,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
