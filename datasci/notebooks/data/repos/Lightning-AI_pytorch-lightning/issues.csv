Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning,3054865516,20812,Reloading every_n_epochs (trainer flag reload_dataloaders_every_n_epochs) not working in 2.5.1.,"### Bug description

When using pytorch-lightning==2.5.1, the train_dataloader() method of a LightningDataModule is only called once at the very beginning of the training process (before Epoch 0), even when trainer.reload_dataloaders_every_n_epochs is explicitly set to 1 on the Trainer instance.

The expected behavior is that train_dataloader() should be called by the Trainer at the start of every epoch (Epoch 1, Epoch 2, etc.) when reload_dataloaders_every_n_epochs=1.

This prevents the intended dynamic reloading or switching of the training dataset each epoch.

Environment:

PyTorch Lightning Version: 2.5.1
PyTorch Version: 2.7.0
Python Version: 3.11
CUDA/GPU information: NVIDIA A100
