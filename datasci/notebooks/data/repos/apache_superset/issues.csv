apache/superset,3054450412,33401,DuckDB error Invalid SSL Certificate Requirements Flag: CERT_NONE,"### Bug description

**How to reproduce the bug**

1. Install Superset 4.1.2 on Kubernetes 1.32.3 using the current Helm Chart 0.14.2 with Helm 3.17.3 and the custom value :
```shell
bootstrapScript: |
  #!/bin/bash
  pip install psycopg2-binary==2.9.6 \
    ""duckdb-engine>=0.12.1, <0.13"" &&\
  if [ ! -f ~/bootstrap ]; then echo ""Running Superset with uid {{ .Values.runAsUser }}"" > ~/bootstrap; fi
```
2. Connect to Superset
3. Add new database
4. In the dropdown select DuckDB database and fill in SQL Alchemy URI: duckdb:///:memory:
5. Click `Test connection "" => OK
6. Click `Finish`to register the database
7. Go to SQL Lab
8. Try to install httpfs extension :
```sql
INSTALL httpfs;
```

**Expected results**

The https extension should be installed and one can proceed with the connection to a S3 repository :

```sql
LOAD https;

SET s3_region='fr-par';
SET s3_endpoint='http://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud';
SET s3_access_key_id='xxxxxxx';
SET s3_secret_access_key='xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx';
SET s3_url_style = 'vhost';
SET s3_use_ssl=true;

SELECT *
FROM 'https://<bucket>.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/naiades_analyse_physicochimie.parquet'
LIMIT 10;
```

**Actual results**

The error `DuckDB error  Invalid SSL Certificate Requirements Flag: CERT_NONE` appears

apache/superset,3048227880,33388,🐛 Creating `Databricks` datasource using `databricks-sqlalchemy~=1` succeeds but stuck in a loop first,"### Bug description

The `[databricks]` extra of the `apache-superset` package installs the deprecated and archived `sqlalchemy-databricks` package, which does not work with databricks anymore after the introduction of Unity catalog and deprecation (and soon removal) of hive metastore. The specific reason is not being able to ignore hidden partitioning columns from delta tables when running `DESCRIBE ...` queries. The new driver, aptly named `databricks-sqlalchemy` for maximum confusion, is a drop-in replacement for the old one, supported by microsoft and should work out of the box. However, I have found one issue that was not there with the old driver.

The datasource is created successfully, but the webserver never returns and the request times out.

Steps to reproduce:
1. From a stock apache/superset docker image, install the new databricks connector with sqlalchemy 1.x support (not the sqlalchemy 2.x one because it won't work with superset)
    ```sh
    pip install databricks-sqlalchemy~=1
    ```
2. In superset, create a datasource, using the sqlalchemy URI like this:
    ```sh
    databricks://token:XXXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXXXXX.azuredatabricks.net:443
    ```
    Include the extra engine parameters to identify a compute cluster to use:
    ```sh
    {""connect_args"":{""http_path"":""/sql/1.0/warehouses/XXXXXXXXXXXX""}}
    ```
    Lastly tick the box to allow selecting a catalog.
3. Create the datasource and observe the browser hanging for ever and a spinner in the UI that does not disappear.
4. Refresh the page and observe the datasource was created successfully after all.

I have noticed that while this is going on, the databricks cluster is receiving `SHOW SCHEMAS` requests constantly in a loop:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5314e4f9-9c3c-4248-8378-12576be283bf)

The server logs are looping until it eventually returns a 201 if the client didn't time out already.

[logs.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20099380/logs.txt)

I suspect what is happening here is that Superset is pre-fetching all schemas in all catalogs, maybe just for testing od populating some cache?

This is not ideal behavior in our environment because we have hundreds of catalogs and would only like to load what we need when we need it.

apache/superset,3048162571,33387,Issue with Jinja Filter Variable Not Passing Value in Superset Dashboard,"### Bug description

Subject: Issue with Jinja Filter Variable Not Passing Value in Superset Dashboard

Facing an issue while using Jinja templating for a filter variable in a SQL Lab query and visualizing it in a dashboard. 

I’ve defined the filter as a Jinja variable using:
{{ experience_threshold | int | default(0) }}
The filter is created manually in the dashboard and linked to the chart.
The experience_threshold is not a column in the dataset—it's a dynamic input only used in the query logic.

Expected Behavior:
The value selected from the dashboard filter should replace the Jinja variable and reflect in the query logic and output.

Actual Behavior:
The query always uses the default value from the Jinja template (0), regardless of the dashboard input.

Could someone help confirm:
If dynamic Jinja filters like this are supported in dashboards?
If so, are there additional configuration steps required to ensure the filter value is passed correctly from the dashboard into the query?

Any guidance or references would be greatly appreciated.

apache/superset,3047659053,33384,fix: Persist catalog change during dataset update + validation fixes,"### SUMMARY
The `catalog` value was not being included in the payload built by the dataset edit modal during updates. This PR includes it when the associated DB connection supports `multi_catalog`. If `multi_catalog` is disabled, then the `dataset.catalog` value is likely the old one (as the modal wouldn't have a catalog dropdown) and therefore is not included -- the backend will enforce the proper default value.

This PR also fixes a couple of other things:
* The `validate` logic was relying on `self._properties.get(""database"")`, but the schema actually expects `database_id`.
* The `validate` logic was always using `self._model.database`, even if the update was re-mapping the dataset to a new DB connection. This would impact the `catalog` assignment, uniqueness validation, etc.

apache/superset,3044383654,33380,How to set up Smart completion,"### Bug description

Hello Superset Community,

I don't know whether the current version 4.1.2 supports smart completion like hue. If it does, can you tell me where and how to set it up? If it doesn't, can this feature be considered for subsequent implementation?

I am currently using superset 4.1.2 and have encountered some problems. I would like to talk to you. When connecting to the trino data source, the schema must be selected on the left to get the table prompt. It is not like the hue below, which can start from the database name and continue to prompt until you find the table you want. In the subsequent release of the new version of superset, it can support whether it is connected to the trino data source or the traditional MySQL. This library table hierarchy can start from the first place and prompt from the catalog to the schema and then to the table, and there is no need to select a schema on the left side of the web before prompting.
Thank you very much!

Adds a required field validation to ensure that users select a column when configuring a native filter of type `filter_select`.

### Bug Fix Summary

Previously, users could create a native filter of type `Value` (i.e., `filter_select`) without choosing a column. This caused runtime issues and invalid filters.

This PR fixes it by enforcing required validation on the column field in the filter configuration panel.

- Set filter type = “Value”
- Do not select column → validation error appears

apache/superset,3039700153,33361,"""Clear All Filters"" sets required time filter to 'No filter', causing downstream filters to error","### Bug description

When using native filters with cascading dependencies in Apache Superset, clearing all filters using the ""Clear All Filters"" button causes the required time range filter (e.g., `""Last week""`) to be set to `No filter`.

Because this time filter is marked as non-optional (`enableEmptyFilter: false`), and other filters depend on it via `cascadeParentIds`, this results in a backend query error when rendering dependent filters:

> Error: INVALID_CAST_ARGUMENT: Value cannot be cast to timestamp: None

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Create a native time filter (type Time range) and mark it as required.
2. Add default value, 'Last Week'
3. Create dependent value filters from dataset that reference this time filter in 'Values are dependent on other filters'.
4. Go to the dashboard view, ensure filters are working as expected.
5. Click ""Clear All Filters"".
6. Observe that:

- The time filter is cleared to No filter, even though it's marked as required.
- Downstream filters immediately error with an invalid cast exception.
- Expected behavior: the time filter should reset to its default value (defaultDataMask) instead of clearing entirely.

Please write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
Example:
fix(dashboard): load charts correctly
-->

# Summary
<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->

1. **Introduction**
The goal of Embedded Themes is to give embedded SDK users the ability to apply themes to their embedded dashboards. After theming capabilities are implemented in superset, embedded dashboards should follow suit.
2. **How does it work**
    Embedded SDK attaches a function called `setThemeConfig` which takes a theme configuration and main application uses this function to apply the specified theme configuration
    
3. **Defining embedded themes**
Argument of `setThemeConfig` is of type `AnyThemeConfig` from @superset-ui/core. This makes defining a custom theme easier for the user. 
> [!NOTE]
> This introduces @superset-ui/core into embedded SDK. It has a small effect on the bundle size and causes some dependency conflicts

4. **Proof of Concept (POC)**
[https://github.com/msyavuz/theme-embedding-poc](https://github.com/msyavuz/theme-embedding-poc)
    POC is a simple full-stack application that handles guest_tokens on the backend and theme embeddings on the frontend.
    
5. **POC Key Code Highlights:**
- `frontend/src/embed.ts`: Does the actual embedding by calling `embedDashboard` function from SDK and applying themes afterward.
- `frontend/src/themes.ts`: Has example theme configurations for popular color schemes
6. **Security Considerations**
    - Theme configurations passed onto the `setThemeConfig` function are sent to the frontend, but I don’t think this introduces an attack vector as similar approaches already existed on the codebase.
7. **Alternative Approaches**
    - Encoding themes and passing the string through URL parameters:
    This alternative was rejected because it has URL size limitations and further complexity of compression and encoding. One upside of this approach is that it isn’t tied to the SDK.

### SUMMARY
<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->

###  🚀 Row Limit Increase
This PR introduces a more flexible and user-aware row limit configuration for the Table visualization in Apache Superset. Previously, the row limit was globally enforced at 100,000 rows via the SQL_MAX_ROW setting. This behavior has now been refined to allow significantly larger datasets when server-side pagination is enabled.

###  🔧  New Config Variables:
Two new configuration options have been introduced in config.py to distinguish row limits based on whether server-side pagination is enabled:

### TABLE_VIZ_MAX_ROW_CLIENT = 100000
→ Maximum number of rows allowed without server-side pagination (frontend capped).

### TABLE_VIZ_MAX_ROW_SERVER = 500000
→ Maximum number of rows allowed with server-side pagination enabled.

### 🎯  Behavior Changes:
If server pagination is disabled, users will continue to be capped at 100,000 rows.

<img width=""1728"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-05-06 at 12 10 46 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82af150c-e41b-417d-ba5d-f196e917fe28"" />

<img width=""1728"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-05-06 at 12 10 58 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea22fa2f-873b-4171-b021-2af0adfe896b"" />


If server pagination is enabled, the row limit increases to 500,000 rows, allowing users to query and paginate through much larger datasets.

<img width=""1728"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-05-06 at 12 11 20 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71ee15a6-e6b4-4a1b-86e4-f39f39b63daa"" />


### ⚠️  Frontend UX Improvements:
A new warning tooltip is shown on the row limit control when a user attempts to fetch more than 100k rows without enabling server pagination. It advises:

“Server pagination must be enabled for row limits over 100,000.”

If a user attempts to exceed 500,000 rows, the tooltip now shows:

“Value cannot exceed 500,000 rows.”

Below are the test cases & expectations of this functionality : 

https://www.notion.so/Table-Performance-Improvements-Test-Cases-1ea89b69c3c48038aec6ddb7be2d7b98

### ↕️ Backend Sorting for Table Charts
This PR introduces backend-driven sorting for Table charts, improving performance and scalability when handling large datasets.

### 📊 Affected Scope:
Applies only to Table visualizations

Sorting is pushed to the database layer when server-side pagination is enabled

<img width=""1728"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-05-06 at 12 14 30 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bda030d-2368-4ca4-950c-6ced1c682473"" />


### ⚙️ Conditional Behavior:
✅ With server pagination enabled:
Sorting is now performed at the backend by injecting an ORDER BY clause in the SQL query. This ensures accurate, efficient sorting even with large datasets (up to 500k rows), and avoids excessive browser-side memory usage.

❌ With server pagination disabled:
Sorting behavior remains frontend-based as before. This is suitable for smaller datasets (under 100k rows), where client-side sorting is performant and simple.


### 📁 Excel/CSV Export Improvements
This PR significantly enhances the export functionality for Excel and CSV downloads from Table charts, making it more intuitive and aligned with user expectations.

### 🛠️ Key Changes:
Simplified Export Format:
Previously, exports were bundled as a .zip file containing two separate Excel files — one for metadata and another for actual data. This extra step caused confusion and was unnecessary. Now, the export returns a single .csv file (or .xlsx if needed) with the complete dataset.

Full Dataset Export (Not Just Current Page):

Before: Only the records shown on the current page (e.g., 10 rows) were exported.

Now: The export includes all records up to the row limit — ensuring that users get the entire dataset, whether that's 100k rows (client mode) or up to 500k (with server pagination enabled).

### ✅ Affects:
Both Excel and CSV export options under the Table visualization.


### 🔍 Backend Search Support for Table Charts
This PR introduces backend search for Table visualizations, enabling efficient, scalable text filtering directly within the database query layer — a major step forward for handling large datasets and improving search accuracy.

### 🧠 Search Logic & SQL Integration:
A new operator, TEXT_SEARCH, has been added to the SQLAlchemy filter operators.

This operator constructs a WHERE clause using a smart pattern with ILIKE for case-insensitive partial matching:

column ILIKE '{pattern}%' OR column ILIKE '% {pattern}%'

This allows matching across both first and last words, e.g., searching “Anderson” will find both John Anderson and Mary Anderson.

### 🧪 Technical Behavior:
Applies only when server-side pagination is enabled

Targets only string-based columns (non-string columns are cast to string when necessary)

Appends the search logic directly into the SQL query using SQLAlchemy

### 🖥️ UI Enhancements:
A new search column dropdown has been added next to the search input

This dropdown lists all string columns of the dataset

When the user types into the search box:

The selected column (from the dropdown) and the input value are combined to generate the appropriate TEXT_SEARCH SQL clause

The dropdown allows users to dynamically change which column the backend search applies to

### 🛠️  Fixes the issue

https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/31626

This issue bascially described that the page doesn't respect the entries per page even when the sql query returns correct number of rows , this was because the transformProps didnt get the correct Page Size , it always used server page length even when it was outdated

apache/superset,3038513535,33356,fix(embedded): handle SUPERSET_APP_ROOT in embedded dashboard URLs,"<!---
Please write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
Example:
fix(dashboard): load charts correctly
-->

### SUMMARY
<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->
This PR adds support for `SUPERSET_APP_ROOT` subpath routing to the embedded dashboard SDK. When Superset is configured with a subpath (e.g., `SUPERSET_APP_ROOT=""/prefix""`), the embedded dashboard SDK now correctly constructs the iframe URL to include this path prefix.

**Problem:**
When embedding dashboards in applications where Superset is deployed with a subpath routing configuration, the SDK would attempt to load the dashboard at `/embedded/{id}` instead of the correct path `/prefix/embedded/{id}`, resulting in 404 errors.

**Solution:**
- Added an optional `appRootPath` parameter to the `EmbedDashboardParams` type
- Modified the `embedDashboard` function to include the application root path in the iframe source URL
- Normalized the app root path to ensure consistent handling (removing trailing slashes)

This change ensures the SDK produces iframe URLs that match Superset's routing configuration, eliminating 404 errors and making the embedded dashboard feature compatible with subpath deployments.

### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF
N/A - This is an SDK fix that affects routing behavior

### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->
1. Configure a Superset instance with `SUPERSET_APP_ROOT=""/prefix""` in the config
2. Use the updated SDK to embed a dashboard:
   ```typescript
   embedDashboard({
     id: ""your-dashboard-id"",
     supersetDomain: ""http://localhost:8088"",
     mountPoint: document.getElementById(""dashboard-container""),
     fetchGuestToken: () => fetchGuestTokenFromYourBackend()
   });
   ```
3. Verify that:
   - The iframe loads successfully without 404 errors
   - The iframe source URL is constructed as `/prefix/embedded/{id}`
   - The embedded dashboard renders correctly
   - API calls within the iframe (like `/prefix/api/v1/me/roles/`) work properly

apache/superset,3037677066,33353,API endpoint SDK (/api/v1/me/roles/) not compatible with SUPERSET_APP_ROOT subpath routing,"### Bug description

When Superset is configured with SUPERSET_APP_ROOT set to a non-root path (e.g., ""/prefix""), the embedded dashboard's API call to /api/v1/me/roles/ fails with a 404 error because the endpoint doesn't account for the application root path.
Reproduction steps:

Configure Superset with SUPERSET_APP_ROOT=""/prefix"" in the config
Embed a dashboard using the embedDashboard() SDK function
Monitor the network requests

Expected behavior:
The API call should go to /prefix/api/v1/me/roles/ (with the app root prefix) to match the subpath routing configuration.
Actual behavior:
The API call goes to /api/v1/me/roles/ (without the prefix), resulting in a 404 error because the route doesn't exist at the root level.
Root cause:
```
In superset-frontend/src/embedded/index.tsx, the start() function has a hardcoded endpoint path that doesn't consider the application root:
typescriptconst getMeWithRole = makeApi<void, { result: UserWithPermissionsAndRoles }>({
  method: 'GET',
  endpoint: '/api/v1/me/roles/',  // Hardcoded path, no app root
});

[here](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5602). The SIP will be numbered by a committer upon acceptance.

## [SIP] Proposal for Timeline Chart Visualization

### Motivation

Apache Superset currently lacks support for timeline-based visualizations, which are essential for analyzing event sequences and durations across a horizontal time axis.

These visualizations are widely used in:
- logistics operations tracking,
- user or system activity timelines,
- manufacturing and process monitoring,
- operations and delivery flow visualization.

Current chart types such as bar, Gantt-like hacks, or boxplots do not sufficiently support the temporal range model and the required UI features (scrolling, zooming, duration visualization).

Introducing a native Timeline Chart will address this gap, making Superset more suitable for operational dashboards where event flow over time is critical.

### Proposed Change

I propose adding a new visualization plugin: **Timeline Chart**, built on **Apache ECharts**.

Key features include:
- Event durations represented as horizontal bars on a continuous time axis.
- Category-based vertical grouping.
- **Fixed left/right time boundaries**, enabling analysts to compare time intervals across days (e.g., 08:00:00–22:00:00).
- Support for **nested subcategories** via a dimension field.
- Zoom and scroll support via ECharts’ native interaction model.

I used this example to implement plugin.
- [ECharts Custom Timeline Demo](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-profile)

### New or Changed Public Interfaces

- A new chart plugin under `plugin-chart-echarts`
- New customization controls in the Explore UI:
  - Time range bounds (left/right)
- Expected input data format:
  - `start_time`, `end_time` (timestamps) for X axis
  - `y_axis` (categories)
  - `dimension` (optional) for legend

### New dependencies

No.

### Migration Plan and Compatibility

- No database migrations required.
- The plugin is fully optional and does not affect backward compatibility.
- URLs and saved charts that use this visualization will remain valid once the plugin is registered.

### Rejected Alternatives

- **Using iframe-based external dashboards**: rejected due to poor integration and limited control.

### SUMMARY
<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->
This PR introduces a new control for the Pie chart that allows you to set a threshold value. If a metric value is smaller than this threshold, it will be grouped in the ""Other"" category.

Additionally, I've added a new control type called `NumberControl` that is used for setting the threshold.

apache/superset,3036534005,33346,RLS does not apply when creating a chart directly from SQL Lab without first saving the query as a dataset.,"### Bug description

**Issue Summary**
When querying a dataset with Row-Level Security (RLS) applied in SQL Lab, the results are correctly filtered. However, if I click ""Create Chart"" directly from SQL Lab (without saving the dataset/virtual dataset), the chart displays the entire unfiltered data, ignoring the RLS restrictions. Ideally, it should only show the filtered data returned in SQL Lab.
We can clearly see that SQL Lab returns only 3 rows — as expected. However, on the chart screen, it displays 125 rows, which is incorrect and indicates that the RLS filter is not being applied.

**Expected Behavior:**
The chart should reflect only the filtered results returned by SQL Lab (i.e., RLS-applied data).

**📷 Evidence:**
**SQL Lab Data Records(RLS)**
<img width=""1590"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83057f64-7a5b-4aeb-a166-ac23a18747c4"" />

<img width=""1199"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cdf06fa-5fd2-45ce-a01f-70ea5e021aa3"" />

**Steps to Reproduce:**

- Query a dataset with RLS in SQL Lab.
- Verify that RLS filters are applied (returns limited rows).
- Click ""Create Chart"" directly from SQL Lab.
- Observe that the chart ignores RLS and shows all rows.

**Notes:**
This seems to be due to the chart being created from a raw SQL result, which doesn't preserve RLS constraints unless it's saved as a dataset or virtual dataset.

apache/superset,3034948966,33341,chore(explore): Add format sql and view in SQL Lab option in View Query,"### SUMMARY
The ""View Query"" feature was previously used to display SQL in a formatted manner. However, the prettier formatting was reverted in [this pull request](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30350) due to unintended changes in the original SQL. To minimize the impact while retaining the formatting option, this commit introduces a ""Format SQL"" feature in View Query modal and an option to show the original SQL for comparison. Additionally, this commit adds a ""View in SQL Lab"" button, allowing users to conveniently connect to SQL Lab directly from the dashboard, which is particularly useful for users.

apache/superset,3034270589,33337,fix: Edge case with metric not getting quoted in sort by when normalize_columns is enabled,"### SUMMARY
When using Snowflake, it's possible to enable the `normalize_columns` setting at the dataset level to have all columns as lowercase. With this setting enabled, in case you use a metric in the chart that has the same key as a column that exists in the dataset (but it's not used in the chart), you would get a SQL error as the metric is used on sorting by default, and the metric name won't be quoted. Superset would generate:

``` sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('DAY', time) AS ""time"", COUNT(*) AS ""count_lower"" 
FROM public.new GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('DAY', time) ORDER BY count_lower DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

As opposed to:
``` sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('DAY', time) AS ""time"", COUNT(*) AS ""count_lower"" 
FROM public.new GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('DAY', time) ORDER BY ""count_lower"" DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

This only happens with this setting enabled. If you disable it and have the columns in uppercase, the exact same chart configuration works.

### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF
No UI changes.

### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a table in Snowflake.
2. Create a dataset for it.
3. Enable `normalize_columns` on the dataset.
4. Sync columns so they revert to lowercase.
5. Create a metric in the dataset with a key named after a column from the table.
6. Create a chart using this metric, and another column.
7. Validate the metric name is properly quoted in the `ORDER BY` statement.

apache/superset,3034201400,33336,DB engine Error when running SELECT query with `limit` column name in SQL Lab,"### Bug description

Hi all, very much an edge case that I am experiencing here;

In SQL Lab, when using an Orcale Database, the following query throws 

`This database does not allow for DDL/DML, and the query could not be parsed to confirm it is a read-only query. Please contact your administrator for more assistance.`

```
SELECT limit FROM my_table;
```

To give some context - we have a column named `limit` which I am aware is an SQL reserved word, it appears that SQL Lab is identifying this as a keyword and is not allowing the statement to be run correctly.

This behavior was not happening on earlier Superset versions.

I have also tried the following;

```
SELECT LIMIT FROM my_table;
```

```
SELECT `limit` FROM my_table;
```

```
SELECT `LIMIT` FROM my_table;
```

All of which yield the same error message.

Turning ON (checking) DDM/DDL statements allow this query to be run correctly, however since we are using Superset in a production environment, I would rather keep this option OFF (unchecked) as a safety net for other users running SQL.

Any help would be much appreciated!

Thanks

apache/superset,3032768709,33309,Thumbnails and dashboard caching does not work in 4.1.11,"### Bug description

After upgrading to 4.1.11, we are seeing an increase in queries to the DB to retrieve thumbnails and dashboard data. These are not getting retrieved from the cache. Is this a known issue, and if so, is there a workaround for this issue? We are not seeing any statement in the log that indicates an attempt to retrieve this information from the cache.

apache/superset,3032582257,33307,Postgres Query will not save as dataset from SQLLab when Create Temp Table is Used,"**### Bug description**

**How to reproduce the bug**
1) In SQL lab, run a query similar to:
       
     CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_file_failures AS
        SELECT 
          DATE(timestamp) AS processing_date,
          COUNT(*) AS file_failures
        FROM file_audit
        WHERE audit_error != '' 
          AND successful_policies_no = 0 
          AND partner != ''
        GROUP BY DATE(timestamp);
        
        select * from temp_file_failures;

2) Select ""Save Dataset""
3) Populate Dataset name
4) Click ""Save and Explorer""

**Expected results:**  Dataset Saved and Chart Editor Launched

**Actual results:** Fatal Error on Saving

### Additional context

Modifying the query to the following allows the dataset to save correctly.  

with temp_file_failures AS ( 
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) AS processing_date,
  COUNT(*) AS file_failures
FROM file_audit
WHERE audit_error != '' 
  AND successful_policies_no = 0 
  AND partner != ''
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp))

select * from temp_file_failures;


Banging my head to figure out why this isn't working (since a lot of our user base uses create temp table queries in SQL Lab.

apache/superset,3031904582,33304,Unable to access swagger API after enabling prefix routing,"### Bug description

I'm having an issue with accessing the ```/api/v1/_openapi ``` endpoint. It looks like it redirects to ```/api/v1/_openapi```  but it should be going to ```/prefix/api/v1/_openapi``` it would be nice to expose the swagger config so we can do something like this. 

```
OPENAPI_SWAGGER_UI_CONFIG = {
    ""url"": ""/prefix/api/v1/_openapi""
} 
```
Not sure if anyone else has seen this issue or is able to replicate it. 

To replicate the issue just set

SUPERSET_APP_ROOT = ""/prefix""

then attempt to go to  /prefix/swagger/v1

apache/superset,3031854975,33303,"fix: `metric.currency` should be JSON, not string","<!---
Please write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
Example:
fix(dashboard): load charts correctly
-->

### SUMMARY
<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->

Currently setting currencies for metrics is broken, because the backend is returning a string while the frontend expects a deserialized JSON object. It seems like someone started adding support for a new attribute called `currency_formats` that has the deserialized JSON, but it's not used anywhere in the application.

I fixed the problem by explicitly setting the column type to JSON. This works even on databases that don't have a native JSON type, since SQLAlchemy offers an abstraction. Having the type set to JSON when we're storing JSON is what we want: invalid JSON can't be stored, we don't need to deal with `json.dumps`/`json.loads`, and we can even search for documents.

Since we have other columns where we store JSON as strings, I wrote the migration logic as a helper function, so that in the future we can improve our schemas by returning objects instead of their serialized versions.

apache/superset,3031598736,33300,fix(chart-data): A lot of idle in transaction session when executing long chart data queries ,"<!---
Please write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
Example:
fix(dashboard): load charts correctly
-->

### SUMMARY
In Superset's current implementation, when fetching data for charts, the metadata database (ex. - PostgreSQL) session remains open throughout the entire query execution. This leads to accumulation of numerous idle sessions in idle in transaction state, particularly under heavy user load or during long-running chart queries.

The common workarounds for this issue involve either is increasing PostgreSQL's max_connections to unreasonably high values (e.g., 1000+), or throttling workload through Celery task limits (when using Global Async Queries), which negatively impacts Superset's performance.

### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF
Look at the count and  duration of ""idle in transaction"" sessions in DBeaver chart

# Before

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c385785-e395-4283-bc46-db245203fb91


# After
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2c46bc2-a928-4c14-a762-e3952fbbf610


In my PR I've modified the session handling logic:
 - Close the session before executing chart data query, releasing the metadata database connection
 - Reopen the session after query completion with loading previously removed SQLAlchemy objects 


### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a Session Monitoring Chart in DBeaver.
Use this SQL to track session states in your metadata database:
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'active') AS active_sessions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle') AS idle_sessions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle in transaction') AS idle_in_transaction
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE usename <> 'postgres' and datname = 'superset';
```
3. Simulate a Slow Query in Superset using next virtual dataset:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM generate_series(1, 50000000) a
CROSS JOIN generate_series(1, 50000000) b
LIMIT 1000000000;
```
4. Open this chart in Superset.
5. While it loads, observe the session metrics in DBeaver

apache/superset,3030609452,33296,fix(template_processing): get_filters now works for IS_NULL and IS_NOT_NULL operators,"### SUMMARY
The macro `get_filters` within the Jinja context can be used to implement filtering in custom locations in your virtual dataset SQL. This works great, except for when filtering with the IS_NULL or IS_NOT_NULL operator. These are ignored, cannot be used, and will break certain implementations that rely on remove_filter to be functional (like the one I've outlined below).

The reason the code breaks for these operators is because they are unique in the sense that they don't have a comparator. Adjusting the code to not need a comparator for these operator types fixes the issue.


### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a virtual dataset on BigQuery with the following SQL 
- likely reproducible with less - but it's vital that both column selection/grouping and filtering is handled
- not a BigQuery specific bug, thats just the database I use
```
{% set finalColumns = columns if columns is defined else ['__ALL__'] %}

SELECT


  sum(measure) as measure,
  
  {% for col in finalColumns %}

  	{% if col == 'col1' or col == '__ALL__' or (col is mapping and 'sqlExpression' in col and col.sqlExpression == 'col1') %}
  		col1
  		{%- if col == '__ALL__' -%},{%- endif -%}
  		{%- if not loop.last -%},{%- endif -%}
  	{% endif %}
  	
  	{% if col == 'col2' or col == '__ALL__' or (col is mapping and 'sqlExpression' in col and col.sqlExpression == 'col2') %}
  		col2
  		{%- if col == '__ALL__' -%},{%- endif -%}
  		{%- if not loop.last -%},{%- endif -%}
  	{% endif %}
  	
  {% endfor %}
  
FROM UNNEST([

])

{% for filter in get_filters('col1', remove_filter=True) -%}
    {%- if loop.first %} WHERE 1 = 1 {% endif %}
    AND
    {% if filter.get('op') == 'IN' -%}
        col1 IN {{ filter.get('val')|where_in }}
    {% elif filter.get('op') == 'NOT IN' -%}
        col1 NOT IN {{ filter.get('val')|where_in }}
    {% elif filter.get('op') == 'ILIKE' -%}
        LOWER(col1) LIKE LOWER({{ filter.get('val') }})
    {% elif filter.get('op') == 'IS NULL' -%}
        col1 IS NULL
    {% elif filter.get('op') == 'IS NOT NULL' -%}
        col1 IS NOT NULL

{%- endfor %}

-- GROUP BY
  
{% set ns = namespace(groupByEmitted=false) %}

{% for col in finalColumns %}

	{% if col == 'col1' or col == '__ALL__' or (col is mapping and 'sqlExpression' in col and col.sqlExpression == 'col1') %}

		{% endif -%}
		col2
		{%- if not loop.last -%},{%- endif -%}
	{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
  
``` 

3. Click ""Create Chart""
4. Set a filter on one of the columns but don't select it as a dimension:
<img width=""325"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9fe440b-6a31-4cd0-9a97-e1e1967a4e9b"" />

5. On master, this breaks due to the following resulting SQL:

```
SELECT `measure` AS `measure`, `col2` AS `col2` 
FROM (
  SELECT
    sum(measure) as measure,
    col2
    
  FROM UNNEST([
    STRUCT(1 as measure, 'value1A' as col1, 'value2A' as col2),
    STRUCT(2 as measure, 'value1A' as col1, 'value2B' as col2),
    STRUCT(5 as measure, 'value1B' as col1, 'value2B' as col2),
    STRUCT(15 as measure, NULL as col1, NULL as col2)
  ])
	
  GROUP BY		
		col2
) AS `virtual_table` 
WHERE `col1` IS NULL
 LIMIT 1000
```

7. With this fix implemented, this works and the resulting SQL looks like this:

```
SELECT `measure` AS `measure`, `col2` AS `col2` 
FROM (

SELECT

  sum(measure) as measure,
  col2
  
FROM UNNEST([
  STRUCT(1 as measure, 'value1A' as col1, 'value2A' as col2),
  STRUCT(2 as measure, 'value1A' as col1, 'value2B' as col2),
  STRUCT(5 as measure, 'value1B' as col1, 'value2B' as col2),
  STRUCT(15 as measure, NULL as col1, NULL as col2)
])

 WHERE 1 = 1 
  AND
  col1 IS NULL
	
	GROUP BY	
		col2

) AS `virtual_table`
 LIMIT 1000
```

apache/superset,3030403333,33294,Virtual Dataset get_filters ignores IS NULL and IS NOT NULL filters,"### Bug description

Using the `get_filters` jinja macro inside of a virtual dataset does not get a filter if the operator is set to IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. Because of this it also does not remove them when `remove_filter` is set to `true`.

IS NULL and IS NOT NULL filters are the only SIMPLE filters that do not have a `comparator`. They fail this check.

Proposed fix: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/33296

This can be confusing, especially when the dataset is large or when filters/pagination are applied, because the visible data doesn't match the summary shown.

📌 Steps to reproduce:
Create a table chart using a dataset with multiple rows.

Enable group by on a column (e.g., category or region).

Enable ""Show summary row"" in the chart settings.

Apply filters or scroll through paginated views.

❌ Problem:
The summary row displays totals for all data returned by the query, not only for the visible rows on screen.

It creates a mismatch between what the user sees and what the summary shows.

✅ Expected behavior:
The summary should either:

Reflect only the visible rows in the current page/group, or

Include an indicator that it shows totals for the full dataset.

📌 Steps to reproduce:
Create a table chart with a dataset large enough to require pagination.

Enable server-side pagination.

Try to search for a value that exists on a different page (not currently visible).

The search input does not return any results unless the value is present in the currently displayed page.

🔎 Expected behavior:
The search bar should filter the entire result set returned by the query, not just the current page.

apache/superset,3029071290,33284,Stacked Bar Chart doesn't update the bar totals when excluding certain dimensions from the legend,"### Bug description

**Recreation Steps**
1. Create a stacked Bar Chart with two or more dimensions
2. Add Legends to the chart
3. Show Totals on the bar
4. Use the legend to exclude one of the dimensions

**Expected Result**
The total on top of each bar adjusts to show the total based on the specific selection, along with the adjustment of the Y Axis. For example in the screenshots below the second picture should not be showing 156, 279, 374 & 81 in the last 4 bars

**Actual Result**
Instead even upon excluding one of the dimensions even though the Y axis correctly updates. The total still show the values as if all dimensions were selected.  And does not include any totals when the dimension that is on the top is removed
