Hello @antonio-andrade! I'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), here to help you with bugs, answer your questions, and assist you on your journey as a contributor. While you wait for a human maintainer, feel free to share more about your issue, and I'll do my best to assist you!

<!-- Answer -->
The error ""Invalid SSL Certificate Requirements Flag: CERT_NONE"" suggests that there might be an issue with how SSL certificates are being handled in your DuckDB setup within Superset. This error typically occurs when the SSL configuration is not set correctly or when an unsupported SSL flag is used.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

1. **SSL Configuration**: Ensure that the SSL settings in your DuckDB connection are correctly configured. The error indicates that `CERT_NONE` is not a valid flag, so you might need to adjust the SSL certificate requirements. Check if there are any specific SSL settings required by DuckDB or Superset that you might have missed.

2. **DuckDB Version**: Verify that the version of DuckDB you are using is compatible with the SSL settings you are trying to apply. Sometimes, newer versions of libraries or engines have different requirements or deprecate certain flags.

3. **Superset Configuration**: Double-check the Superset configuration to ensure that it supports the SSL settings you are trying to use. There might be additional configuration needed in Superset to handle SSL connections properly.

4. **Python Environment**: Since the connection works fine with a standalone Python script, compare the environment and dependencies used in the script with those in the Superset environment. There might be differences in library versions or configurations that could affect SSL handling.

5. **Helm Chart and Kubernetes**: Ensure that the Helm Chart and Kubernetes configurations are correctly set up to support SSL connections. There might be environment variables or configurations that need to be adjusted to allow SSL connections.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to look into the specific SSL requirements and configurations for DuckDB and how they are integrated with Superset.

I found some similar threads that might be relevant to your issue:

1. [Installing error](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/33017) - This discussion is open and might contain useful insights for installation errors <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/33017)</sup>.
2. [Issues with NPM run build version 4.1.1](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/31923) - This discussion is open and addresses issues with the `npm run build` step, which could be similar to what you're experiencing <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/31923)</sup>.

To resolve the error during the `npm run build` step for Apache Superset version 4.1.2, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure you are using the correct versions of Node.js and npm as specified in the project's package.json file. Apache Superset requires Node.js version 20.16.0 and npm version 10.8.1. Update your Dockerfile or environment to use these versions to prevent build freezes.

2. Add npm to the system dependencies in your Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
RUN /app/docker/apt-install.sh build-essential python3 zstd npm
```

3. Configure npm to use a mirror registry:
```bash
npm config set registry http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/
```

4. Ensure you have the latest code by pulling from the master branch.

5. Access Superset through port 9000 (http://localhost:9000) instead of port 8088.

6. In docker-compose.yml, set the Superset URL to 'http://superset:8088' instead of 'http://host.docker.internal:8088'.

These changes should help resolve the 'npm run build' failure in the Docker setup by ensuring compatibility with the project's requirements and proper communication between containers <sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/31714)</sup><sup>[[4]](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33050)</sup>.

The issue you're experiencing with the `databricks-sqlalchemy` driver in Superset seems to be related to the pre-fetching of schemas and catalogs. Superset determines which schemas and catalogs to pre-fetch by checking user permissions for catalog access, schema access, and datasource access. This process involves querying the database for accessible catalogs and schemas, which might be causing the repeated `SHOW SCHEMAS` requests you're observing <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/security/manager.py)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/README.md)</sup>.

To address this, you might want to look into how Superset handles the pre-fetching logic and see if there are configuration options or code modifications that can limit the scope of these queries to only the necessary catalogs and schemas. This could potentially reduce the load and prevent the looping behavior you're encountering.

The pre-fetching of schemas and catalogs in Superset occurs in the `useSchemas` function within the `superset-frontend/src/hooks/apiResources/schemas.ts` file. This function uses the `useLazySchemasQuery` and `useSchemasQuery` hooks to trigger the fetching of schemas. The `fetchData` function is responsible for making the request to fetch schemas, and it is called within a `useEffect` hook to automatically fetch data when the `dbId` or `catalog` changes. This setup could lead to repeated `SHOW SCHEMAS` requests if the `dbId` or `catalog` changes frequently or if the `forceRefresh` parameter is set to true. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
    fetchData(dbId, catalog, false);
  }, [dbId, catalog, fetchData]);
```

This `useEffect` hook triggers the `fetchData` function whenever `dbId` or `catalog` changes, potentially causing repeated requests <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/hooks/apiResources/schemas.ts)</sup>.

Hello @Nethaje! 👋 I'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), your friendly bug-squashing bot here to help tackle issues, answer your questions, and assist with contributions while you wait for a human maintainer. Let's get to work! 🚀

<!-- Answer -->
I found a similar unsolved discussion that might be relevant to your issue: [Jinja Template](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/30448), which was last updated on April 22, 2025 <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/30448)</sup>.

Regarding your question, dynamic Jinja filters are supported in Superset dashboards. To ensure the filter value is passed correctly from the dashboard into the query, you can use the `{{ filter_values() }}` function. This function retrieves the value for a specific filter as a list, which can then be used in your SQL query. For example:

```sql
SELECT action, count(*) as times
FROM logs
WHERE
    action in {{ filter_values('action_type')|where_in }}
GROUP BY action
```

In this example, `filter_values('action_type')` retrieves the filter values for 'action_type', and the `where_in` filter converts this list into a string suitable for an `IN` expression in SQL <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/configuration/sql-templating.mdx)</sup>. 

You might need to adjust your query to use `filter_values()` to ensure the dynamic input is correctly passed from the dashboard.

I found a similar unsolved discussion titled [Smart completion like hue](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/33270), which was last updated on April 29, 2025 <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/33270)</sup>.

Regarding your question, Superset version 4.1.2 does support an autocomplete feature for SQL queries. The autocomplete functionality includes schema and table suggestions, which are generated using the `useMemo` hook to map over available schema and table options. This feature provides suggestions with associated metadata like `name`, `value`, `score`, and `meta` <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/AceEditorWrapper/useKeywords.ts)</sup>.

However, the current implementation requires selecting a schema on the left to get table prompts, which differs from Hue's behavior. There are no specific details available about plans to enhance this feature to match Hue's functionality in future releases <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/33270)</sup>.

If you want to adjust the behavior of the autocomplete feature, you can modify the autocomplete score weights in the configuration settings to prioritize different types of suggestions <sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/constants.ts)</sup>.

Hello @seqwait! I'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), a friendly bot here to help you solve bugs, answer questions, and guide you as a contributor while you wait for a human maintainer. Let's tackle that ClickHouse connection issue together!

<!-- Answer -->
The issue you're experiencing, where the ClickHouse connection remains in a pending state, could be related to several factors. Here are some potential causes and solutions:

1. **Async Query Initialization**: The pending state might be due to the initialization of async query jobs, which set the status to `STATUS_PENDING` initially. This is a normal part of the process before the job starts running or encounters an error <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/async_events/async_query_manager.py)</sup>.

2. **Timeout Settings**: Check the timeout settings for database connections in Superset. You can configure these settings in the Superset configuration file. For example, `SQLLAB_TIMEOUT`, `SUPERSET_TIMEOUT`, and `SUPERSET_SQLALCHEMY_TIMEOUT` are some of the parameters you can adjust to change the timeout duration <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/33218)</sup>.

3. **Network Issues**: Ensure there are no network issues that might be causing the request to hang. Superset handles network errors by providing specific error messages, such as 'Network error' for failed fetch attempts <sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/src/query/getClientErrorObject.ts)</sup>.

4. **ClickHouse Configuration**: Verify that the ClickHouse connection string and parameters are correctly configured. Ensure that the `clickhouse-connect` library is installed and the connection string is formatted correctly <sup>[[4]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docs/docs/configuration/databases.mdx)</sup>.

5. **Retry Mechanisms**: Superset has retry mechanisms for handling failed connection attempts. Ensure that these are functioning correctly and that the system is not stuck in a retry loop <sup>[[5]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/src/connection/constants.ts)</sup>.

If none of these solutions resolve the issue, consider checking the Superset logs for any error messages or stack traces that might provide more insight into the problem.

Hello @jaki102! I'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), a friendly bot here to help you solve bugs, answer questions, and guide you in becoming a contributor. I'm here while you wait for a human maintainer. Let's tackle this together! 😊

<!-- Answer -->
The ""Select all"" option in the `Select.tsx` file is indeed hardcoded and not localized. Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific information about any plans to fix this issue or details about the comment with a TODO in the `Select.tsx` file regarding localization <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/components/Select/Select.tsx)</sup>. 

For localization in Superset, the functions `t()` and `tn()` from the `@superset-ui/core` package are used. These could potentially be applied to localize the ""Select all"" option <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/test/translation/index.test.ts)</sup>. Additionally, the current localization setup in Superset involves language packs and configurations that support multiple languages <sup>[[3]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/test/translation/languagePacks/en.ts)</sup><sup>[[4]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/CHANGELOG.md)</sup>.

If you are looking to implement localization for this option, you might consider using these existing localization mechanisms.

Hello @harelorinctera! I'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), a friendly bot here to help you with bugs, answer your questions, and assist you in becoming a contributor. I'm here while you wait for a human maintainer. How can I assist you today?

<!-- Answer -->
The issue you're experiencing with the ""Clear All Filters"" button setting a required time filter to 'No filter' seems to be related to how Superset handles default values and required filters. When the ""Clear All Filters"" button is used, Superset should ideally reset the filter to its default value instead of clearing it entirely, especially if the filter is marked as required.

The logic for handling default values in native filters involves checking configurations like `defaultToFirstItem` and `enableEmptyFilter`. If `defaultToFirstItem` is enabled, the default value is set to the first item automatically. If `enableEmptyFilter` is false, a default value must be set when the filter is required <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/nativeFilters/FiltersConfigModal/FiltersConfigForm/state.ts)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/nativeFilters/FiltersConfigModal/FiltersConfigForm/DefaultValue.tsx)</sup>.

In your case, it seems that the required time filter is not reverting to its default value when ""Clear All Filters"" is triggered, which leads to the backend query error due to the absence of a valid timestamp. This behavior might be a bug in the current version of Superset (4.0.2) you are using.

To address this, you might want to ensure that the default value logic is correctly implemented in your filter configuration. If the issue persists, it may require a fix in the Superset codebase to ensure that required filters revert to their default values when cleared, rather than being set to 'No filter'.

1. In general, any PR that changes the UI/UX significantly should go [through a discussion](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5602). For uncontroversial changes the process is usually quick, since you can request ""lazy consensus"" and people don't have to vote. I think we're OK in this one, just letting you know for the future.
2. Splitting the PR into 4 would've been better, even if it takes more time/work upfront. It makes reviews quicker and it's simpler to revert features if something goes wrong.
3. I'm a bit concerned about the performance of the `LIKE` search, and wondering if we should have optional ways of optimizing it, but let me look at the PR in details before we start worrying about this. (For example, will this do a full table scan on BigQuery?)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for opening a PR to fix the issue. I noticed it as well, but ended up monkey patching during deployment on my side for the time-being.

In my first attempt I tried to replace only `/api/v1/me/roles/` with the expected path, but it was not enough: React routes, e.g. `<Route path=""/embedded/:uuid/"" component={EmbeddedRoute} />`, are also broken. When I ""fixed"" the routes, dashboard started loading, but all API calls the dashboard itself is making (like `/api/v1/dashboard` etc.) were still using the wrong path.

I suspect that the following changes have to be done to fix all of the above:
```ts
import getBootstrapData, { applicationRoot } from 'src/utils/getBootstrapData';

...

const EmbeddedApp = () => (
  <Router basename={applicationRoot()}>
    {/* todo (embedded) remove this line after uuids are deployed */}
    <Route path=""/dashboard/:idOrSlug/embedded/"" component={EmbeddedRoute} />
    <Route path=""/embedded/:uuid/"" component={EmbeddedRoute} />
  </Router>
);

...

function setupGuestClient(guestToken: string) {
  setupClient({
    appRoot: applicationRoot(),
    guestToken,
    guestTokenHeaderName: bootstrapData.config?.GUEST_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME,
    unauthorizedHandler: guestUnauthorizedHandler,
  });
}
```


`<Router basename={applicationRoot()}>` is taken from `App.tsx`, 
`setupClient({ appRoot: applicationRoot() });` is used in `preamble.ts`.

Since `makeApi` by default uses singleton of `SupersetClient`, which is configured by `setupClient`, we should not have to modify the actual '/api/v1/me/roles/' endpoint with these changes, and all other ""broken"" api calls should also be fixed automatically.

Anyways, these are simply my guesses and I'm quite new to Superset. Maybe later this month I or one of my colleagues will have time to verify the theories locally, and we would be happy to help moving this forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay, I can 100% confirm that the changes  that @morngaraf mentioned worked locally. I was able to get the embedded section working . To test I built the image, tagged it locally then spun up a container and called it from my webapp. I can add a screenshot of the network call if that helps.

Hello @smile2008! I'm here to help you with any bugs, questions, or contributions you have in mind. Let's tackle this issue together while we wait for a human maintainer. How can I assist you today?

<!-- Answer -->
To resolve the ""Error: Cannot find module '@airbnb/config-babel'"" when running ""npm run build"" for your Superset plugin, you need to install the missing module. You can do this by running the following command in the `/tmp/superset-plugin-chart-hello-world` directory:

```bash
npm install @airbnb/config-babel@^2.2.4
```

This will install the required module specified in the `peerDependencies` section of your package configuration, ensuring compatibility with other dependencies <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/packages/generator-superset/generators/plugin-chart/templates/package.erb)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/packages/generator-superset/generators/plugin-chart/templates/package-lock.erb)</sup>.

The error ""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'spec')"" during the npm install process might be related to a corrupted npm cache or a problem with the npm version. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear npm cache**: Run the following command to clear the npm cache, which might resolve any corruption issues:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Reinstall npm**: Sometimes, reinstalling npm can fix underlying issues. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

3. **Check npm configuration**: Ensure that your npm configuration files (`.npmrc`) do not contain any incorrect or conflicting settings. You can temporarily rename or remove these files to test if they are causing the issue.

4. **Use a different Node.js version**: Although your current Node.js version (v20.19.1) should be compatible, you can try switching to a different version using nvm (Node Version Manager) to see if it resolves the issue:
   ```bash
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   ```

5. **Install dependencies with a different approach**: If the above steps don't work, try installing the dependencies using a different approach, such as using `yarn` instead of `npm`:
   ```bash
   yarn add @airbnb/config-babel@^2.2.4
   ```

These steps should help you troubleshoot and resolve the installation error. If the issue persists, it might be worth checking the npm issue tracker for any known bugs related to your npm version.

To resolve the issue with the API endpoint not accounting for the `SUPERSET_APP_ROOT` subpath routing, you can modify the endpoint to dynamically include the application root. This can be achieved by using the `getUrl` method from the `SupersetClientClass` in the Superset SDK. Here's how you can adjust the endpoint in your code:

Replace the hardcoded endpoint in `superset-frontend/src/embedded/index.tsx` with a dynamic one:

```typescript
import { SupersetClient } from 'superset-ui-core';

Hello @teocherasco! I'm here to help you tackle any bugs, answer your questions, and guide you as you contribute. While we wait for a human maintainer, feel free to share more about your issue! 🚀

<!-- Answer -->
I found a similar closed issue regarding the reconnection to PostgreSQL failing with a ""Database Creation Error"" after changing the DB password on AWS RDS. The issue was related to the SQL Alchemy URI not being updated with the new password, which could cause the connection to fail despite successful connection tests <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/commands/database/validate.py)</sup>.

Additionally, the error log mentions the 'ab_view_menu_id_seq' sequence, which is used to generate unique IDs for the 'id' column in the 'ab_view_menu' table. If this sequence is missing, it might be due to an incomplete or incorrect database migration <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/migrations/versions/2020-09-24_12-04_3fbbc6e8d654_fix_data_access_permissions_for_virtual_.py)</sup>.

To resolve the issue, ensure that the SQL Alchemy URI in Superset's configuration is updated with the new password. Also, verify that the database schema is correctly set up, including the presence of the 'ab_view_menu_id_seq' sequence.

You should not manually create the ""ab_view_menu_id_seq"" sequence in your database schema. This sequence is defined in the code using SQLAlchemy's `Sequence` class, which should automatically handle its creation when the database schema is created or migrated using SQLAlchemy's migration tools. To resolve this issue, ensure that your database migrations are properly set up and executed. You can do this by running the following command to apply the necessary migrations:

```bash
superset db upgrade
```

This command will execute the migration scripts and should automatically create the required sequence and any other necessary database objects <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/migrations/shared/security_converge.py)</sup>.

I investigated the UI loading issue related to issue #33347 and made progress debugging it. The UI failed to display content due to missing frontend assets, with browser errors: `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8088/ws' failed` and `[webpack-dev-server] Trying to reconnect...`. I found an `npm install` error caused by a missing root `package.json` but confirmed `superset-frontend/package.json` was present. The `npm run build` process got stuck at 92% (TerserPlugin), possibly due to resource constraints.

I also verified the Docker setup (`postgres-data` on port 5432, `postgres-meta` on port 5433) and prepared steps to reproduce the issue (connect `data_db`, change password, run query). I’ve documented my findings in this gist: https://gist.github.com/UncoveredBread/7cee6de36f8ca0368821b4857825a00e. I couldn’t fully resolve the UI issue, but I’m happy to assist further or provide more details!

The issue you're experiencing is related to how Apache Superset handles Row-Level Security (RLS) when creating charts directly from SQL Lab. When you create a chart directly from SQL Lab without saving the query as a dataset, the RLS filters are not applied. This is because the chart creation process from SQL Lab does not automatically incorporate RLS constraints unless the query is saved as a dataset or virtual dataset first.

In Superset, RLS is typically applied when queries are executed within SQL Lab, and the results are correctly filtered. However, when transitioning directly to chart creation from SQL Lab, the RLS predicates are not automatically included in the chart's data source unless the query is saved as a dataset. This behavior is due to the way Superset handles data sources for charts, which requires the dataset to be explicitly defined with RLS constraints.

To ensure that RLS is applied when creating charts, you should save the SQL Lab query as a dataset first. This will preserve the RLS constraints and ensure that the chart reflects the filtered data as expected.
