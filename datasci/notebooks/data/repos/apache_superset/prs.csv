apache/superset,44299234,20,"add tzinfo config, useful when start druid without utc timezone","I startup druid cluster with `America/Los_Angeles` timezone(both cluster instances and druid commands).

Then I found the query of table view(Now: 02:05:56 PDT / 10:05:56 UTC), the intervals of query using none timezone information:

```
// Two phase query
// Phase 1
{
  ""dimensions"": [], 
  ""aggregations"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""count"", 
      ""name"": ""count""
    }
  ], 
  ""intervals"": ""2015-09-05T02:05:56/2015-09-06T02:05:56"", 
  ""dataSource"": ""...""
...
```

It queried data before `2015-09-06T02:05:56 UTC`, but can not query data between `2015-09-06T02:05:57 UTC ~ 2015-09-06T10:05:56 UTC`. May be it would be `""intervals"": ""2015-09-05T02:05:56-07:00/2015-09-06T02:05:56-07:00""`.

so I add this tzinfo configure, setting `DRUID_TZ = tz.tzlocal()` when start druid without UTC timezone(of course, it also work fine if both cluster instances and druid using UTC timezone).

Introduced a `px` object with `registerWidget` function to register a widget initializer and `initializeWidget` which is called on document ready and returns an object with `{render, resize}` functions. 

Migrated word cloud, big number and nvd3 widgets. 

Follow-up work
- Migration of table and markup widget, they serve static html and will need extra migration work.
- Break visualization into separate render and resize function, where resize doesn't fetch data.

Test plan
- Load example dashboard.
- Load all example slices.

apache/superset,53790415,86,adjusting date formats,"to: @michellethomas @mistercrunch 
Hey guys,

I made some updates to the date formats that I think make them much more useful. The basic problem I was trying to solve is just adding more context to the charts about what you were looking at. Sometimes, the day of week was shown, or just the month and it was unclear what you were looking at. I tried to keep it clean like it was, but also add more context. The goal is to make it less likely to make a mistake when people are passing around screen shots. 

I did another small fix where I made the y-axis format on the context chart the same as on the main y-axis. 

For adjusting the dates, I just changed the rules and then also added margin on the right to accommodate the longer dates, added a staggered effect to prevent overlapping, and took away a little height to make everything fit. 

I tested it with my own dataset which I decided to not include as a default. It isn't all that interesting. 

LMK if you have any questions and here are some pre/post screen shots.

apache/superset,53890117,87,fixing a few bugs with tool tip overflow,"@mistercrunch 
this fixes a few issues with the tooltips that were introduced with my last change. 

Specifically, it makes the tooltips flow over elements to their right by setting the z-index of more left columns in the dashboard thus the tooltip will always flow over the more right elements. 

It also scales the charts in the dashboard down 5% so there is no bleeding out of the bottom.

apache/superset,54020685,89,Featured datasets,"Hi,

This creates a page for featured datasets. 

Major changes:
-Adding featured datasets page and corresponding css stylesheet
-Adding is_featured to Sqlatable and Datasource models and creating a database migration for the upgrade.
-Adding user_id as an owner to Sqlatables, creating a relationship with the ab_user table, and creating a database migration for the upgrade
-Adding both is_featured and owner into the views
-Adding a link to featured datasets into the navbar

Notes:
-The database migration for user_id in Sqlatables was a little complicated. It seems that Alembic has problems with multiple alter table statements in one update, so I had to add batch_alter_tables, and it also defaulted to having no name for the constraint (which threw an error so I named it ""user_id"".
-Spent a while fixing the downgrade function for the sqlatables user_id db migration. I believe because I'm batch altering a table, it already has the table_name, so alembic doesn't need it when I'm calling drop_constraint and drop_column
-It looks like in views.py appbuilder shows the links in the order that you add them to the file. If we want to add featured datasets to the top, I had to put the add_link in at the top of the file, away from the featured_datasets function.
-Ran run_tests.sh and passed
