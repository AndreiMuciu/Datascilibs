afshinea/stanford-cs-229-machine-learning,2618236916,29,"Error in p-norm definition, Algebra & Calculus refresher","Hi, thanks for putting together & sharing this information source.

I believe there is an error in the p-norm formula, in the [Algebra and Calculus refresher](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/refresher-algebra-calculus#properties):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cff602b-e48e-47c3-adff-7be1dd9af6df)
I think $x_i^p$ should be replaced with $|x_i|^p$. This way, we end up with the L1 norm (Manhattan distance) when p = 1.

You did not explain the mathematical notation ( like %99 of the teachers ) in your cheat sheets, it looks like a textbook  therefore they are not useful for the beginners.  It is possible that a beginner does not heard anything about transpose of a matrix, gradient, Laplacian, or even what conditional probability is. At least you should note the requirements for the learners.
