I believe there is an error in the p-norm formula, in the [Algebra and Calculus refresher](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/refresher-algebra-calculus#properties):

I think $x_i^p$ should be replaced with $|x_i|^p$. This way, we end up with the L1 norm (Manhattan distance) when p = 1.

afshinea/stanford-cs-229-machine-learning,2394209306,28,Math notation,"I appreciate your work, however there are some major drawbacks. Notation is not clear.  You did not explain the mathematical notation ( like %99 of the teachers ) in your cheat sheets, it looks like a textbook  therefore they are not useful for the beginners.  It is possible that a beginner does not heard anything about transpose of a matrix, gradient, Laplacian, or even what conditional probability is. At least you should note the requirements for the learners.
