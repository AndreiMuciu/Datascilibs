dair-ai/ML-YouTube-Courses,2989326532,48,Add Pollinations.AI as a generative AI resource for students,"## Description
This PR adds Pollinations.AI as a free generative AI resource for students learning machine learning. It introduces a new section ""Generative AI Tools and Resources"" to complement the existing course content.

### Added Components:
1. New section in the table of contents for ""Generative AI Tools and Resources""
2. Detailed description of Pollinations.AI with its key features for students:
   - No signup required
   - No API key needed
   - Free to use
   - Multiple modalities (text, image, audio)
   - OpenAI-compatible API
   - Educational focus

### Why Pollinations.AI is valuable for ML students:
- **Hands-on learning**: Students can immediately experiment with generative AI models without setup barriers
- **Practical application**: Complements theoretical course content with practical tools
- **Accessibility**: Free access makes it ideal for educational settings
- **API experience**: Students can learn industry-standard API patterns
- **Prompt engineering practice**: Provides a platform to test and refine prompts

This addition enhances the repository by providing students with a practical tool to experiment with the generative AI concepts they learn about in the courses listed in this repository.
