dair-ai/ML-YouTube-Courses,2989326532,48,Add Pollinations.AI as a generative AI resource for students,"## Description
This PR adds Pollinations.AI as a free generative AI resource for students learning machine learning. It introduces a new section ""Generative AI Tools and Resources"" to complement the existing course content.

### Added Components:
1. New section in the table of contents for ""Generative AI Tools and Resources""
2. Detailed description of Pollinations.AI with its key features for students:
   - No signup required
   - No API key needed
   - Free to use
   - Multiple modalities (text, image, audio)
   - OpenAI-compatible API
   - Educational focus

### Why Pollinations.AI is valuable for ML students:
- **Hands-on learning**: Students can immediately experiment with generative AI models without setup barriers
- **Practical application**: Complements theoretical course content with practical tools
- **Accessibility**: Free access makes it ideal for educational settings
- **API experience**: Students can learn industry-standard API patterns
- **Prompt engineering practice**: Provides a platform to test and refine prompts

This addition enhances the repository by providing students with a practical tool to experiment with the generative AI concepts they learn about in the courses listed in this repository.

It has 2.1 million views across the 11 videos. If you'd like to read some of the comments people have left about the course, please scroll to the ""Comments from my students"" section on [this page](https://courses.dataschool.io/introduction-to-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn). (That page also lists all of the topics that are covered in the course.)

It is not a recent course, since I posted it in 2015 and 2016. However, very little has changed in the scikit-learn API since 2015 that is relevant to the course, and all of the ML principles I teach in the course are still up-to-date and relevant. As well, I updated all of the code (and fixed any outdated links) in the course's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos) earlier this year.

If you'd like me to add the course, I'm happy to submit a PR. But if this doesn't match what you are looking for, no worries at all!
