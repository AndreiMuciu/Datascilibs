donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks,2661326545,112,Enhancement: Complete AlexNet Architecture with Additional Convolutional Layers (Issue 64),"This pull request enhances the `alexnet.ipynb` notebook by aligning its architecture with the standard AlexNet model. The following changes have been made:

- **Added `conv4` and `conv5` layers** to extend the convolutional section, including pooling, normalization, and dropout for each.
- **Updated the `weights` and `biases` dictionaries** to include parameters for the new layers.
- **Adjusted the input to the fully connected layers** to match the output of the added `conv5` layer.

On the flake8 test selection, this PR does _not_ focus on ""_style violations_"" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).  Instead, these tests are focus on runtime safety and correctness:
* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python, they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.
* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.
* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints
* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python, a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.",cclauss,3709715,closed,False,0,2020-07-24T21:14:20+00:00,2021-08-03T21:52:37+00:00,2021-08-03T21:52:34+00:00,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Really liked the collection of notebooks. I thought it would be cool to also add Algorithmia to the index.

There's a lot of interesting algorithms on the platform. But I only showcased 4 of them as a simple introduction:
- Face Detection
- Content Summarizer
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Optical Character Recognition

Tried to format the notebook according to your writing style as seen in the other notebooks.

Also, the logo won't show up properly on my fork because I've added the absolute path of your repo. Should render without a problem after you merge it.

Full disclosure: I work @Algorithmiaio

Cheers,
Besir

> A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood. DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs.

https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/sql-programming-guide.html#dataframes

Spark 1.6 introduces DataSets:

> A new Dataset API. This API is an extension of Spark’s DataFrame API that supports static typing and user functions that run directly on existing JVM types (such as user classes, Avro schemas, etc). Dataset’s use the same runtime optimizer as DataFrames, but support compile-time type checking and offer better performance. More details on Datasets can be found on the SPARK-9999 JIRA.
