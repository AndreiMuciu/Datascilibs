donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks,55382351,24,Add Algorithmia IPython Notebook example,"Hey Donne,

Really liked the collection of notebooks. I thought it would be cool to also add Algorithmia to the index.

There's a lot of interesting algorithms on the platform. But I only showcased 4 of them as a simple introduction:
- Face Detection
- Content Summarizer
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Optical Character Recognition

Tried to format the notebook according to your writing style as seen in the other notebooks.

Also, the logo won't show up properly on my fork because I've added the absolute path of your repo. Should render without a problem after you merge it.

Full disclosure: I work @Algorithmiaio

Cheers,
Besir

https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html

On the flake8 test selection, this PR does _not_ focus on ""_style violations_"" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).  Instead, these tests are focus on runtime safety and correctness:
* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python, they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.
* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.
* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints
* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python, a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.",cclauss,3709715,closed,False,2020-07-24T21:14:20+00:00,2021-08-03T21:52:37+00:00,2021-08-03T21:52:34+00:00,,6e6c643055275ea5244fa71653266f6dfae9324b,clean,30,0,1,1,0,0,,,
