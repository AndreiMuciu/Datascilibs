visenger/awesome-mlops,2877556157,127,Added Simplismart,"# What is this tool for?
Simplismart is an MLOps platform that enables enterprises to fine-tune, deploy, and optimize GenAI models across the NVIDIA chipset. It ensures seamless model deployment by providing a model-agnostic, cloud-agnostic infrastructure that enhances performance, cost efficiency, and observability while maintaining enterprise control over data privacy and customization.

# What's the difference between this tool and similar ones?
Unlike hyperscalers that enforce platform dependence, Simplismart provides a flexible and efficient inference layer that enterprises can integrate into their existing workflows. It offers performance benefits comparable to proprietary solutions but with greater transparency, cost efficiency, and adaptability.

## Enumerate comparisons.

visenger/awesome-mlops,2657105584,126,Adding Dynamic DevOps Roadmap,"Hi @visenger :wave: 

Thanks for this awesome list 🙌

At the beginning of 2024, I started a FREE DevOps roadmap called [Dynamic DevOps Roadmap](https://devopsroadmap.io/). This roadmap takes a different approach, following the MVP style (non-linear and progressive where each module builds on the previous one).

The roadmap includes an introduction, 6 modules, a progressive project (part of each module), a capstone project, interview questions, and even the next steps in DevOps domain (SRE, Platform, Cloud) and DevOps-like domain (e.g., MLOps, AIOps, DataOps, etc.).

I believe it's a good resource to be added to the MLOps list.

Should I create a PR for it?

It is a collection of cloud-native tools for all of these stages of MLOps:

-Data exploration
-Feature preparation
-Model training/tuning
-Model serving, testing and versioning

Katonic is for both data scientists and data engineers looking to build production-grade machine learning implementations and can be run either locally in your development environment or on a production cluster. Katonic provides a unified system—leveraging Kubernetes for containerization and scalability for the portability and repeatability of its pipelines.

It will be great if you can list it on your account

visenger/awesome-mlops,796087805,42,Reformatting the MLOps section,"Hi,

In a previous PR, I suggested simplifying the section ""MLOps,"" which IMHO looks a little confusing, given that it follows different citation styles.
In response to @visenger [question](https://github.com/visenger/awesome-mlops/pull/41#issuecomment-769107040) (*Would you take the lead and ""chicago-fy"" the paper's references?*), yes, I can do that.
However, on the one hand, I wonder whether adding authors and venue information is really needed, considering that a large part of the text is made of that information, and the remaining is the title, which is the most useful information.
On the other hand, most of the list items in the other sections have an elementary format given by their titles only. 

That being said, I would like to propose two alternatives to reformat the MLOps section:

## Alternative 1
Reformat each item using the title only, and link it to the raw document or its digital library page (if available). For example

**MLOps Papers**
1. [Challenges in deploying machine learning: a survey of case studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09926).
1. [Challenges in the deployment and operation of machine learning in practice](https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2019_rp/163/).
1. [On challenges in machine learning model management](https://web.kaust.edu.sa/Faculty/MarcoCanini/classes/CS290E/F19/papers/challenges.pdf).


## Alternative 2
Reformat each item using the title plus a brief description from its abstract, and link it through a ""Go to paper"" to the raw document or its digital library page (if available). As [here](https://github.com/stefanodallapalma/awesome-mlops/tree/mlops-papers-formatting#mlops-papers). For example:

**MLOps Papers**
1. **(2021) Challenges in deploying machine learning: a survey of case studies.** This survey reviews published reports of deploying machine learning solutions in a variety of use cases, industries and applications and extracts practical considerations corresponding to stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. [Go to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09926).
1. **(2019) Challenges in the deployment and operation of machine learning in practice.** In this work, the authors target to systematically elicit the challenges in deployment and operation to enable broader practical dissemination of machine learning applications. [Go to paper](https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2019_rp/163/).
1. **(2018) On challenges in machine learning model management.** This paper discusses a selection of ML use cases, develops an overview over conceptual, engineering, and data-processing related challenges arising in the management of the
corresponding ML models, and points out future research directions. [Go to paper](https://web.kaust.edu.sa/Faculty/MarcoCanini/classes/CS290E/F19/papers/challenges.pdf).


Alternative 1 is consistent with the rest of the README; while alternative 2 provides more details about each paper without being too difficult too read. In summary, I believe it helps better identify the papers of interest.

While I agree to give credit to the authors of the papers, they are listed in the papers themselves and on the digital library page. Therefore, I found it either redundant and cumbersome. 

**Note:** I do not want to dictate new rules on how to format the document. I simply find that this way would be more effective to identify the resources of interest for a given search, at least for me :)

Of course, I will be in charge of those modifications.
