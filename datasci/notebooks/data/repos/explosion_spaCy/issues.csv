explosion/spaCy,3051766509,13816,"fix: match hyphenated words to lemmas in index_table (e.g. ""co-authorâ€¦","Previously, words with hyphens such as ""co-authored"" could not be matched correctly against the index_table, even though their lemma forms like ""co-author"" existed.
This fix normalizes such words by lemmatizing and aligning them with their base forms, ensuring accurate lookup and processing.

Example:

Input: ""co-authored""
Lemma: ""co-author""
Result: Now correctly matched in index_table

This improves the robustness of word matching, especially for common hyphenated expressions.
